找你借杯糖算过分吗

大家都开始怀疑
The others are beginning to wonder

09:13.730 --> 09:15.920
是不是要敬两次酒了
if we're going to have a double toast.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.760
先生们  上一次进行这项仪式
Gentlemen. I'm thankful to say it's been 17 years

09:22.760 --> 09:26.020

10:02.360 --> 10:05.060
兰斯洛特当时正在调查
Lancelot was investigating a group of mercenaries

10:05.060 --> 10:07.800
一个进行生化武器试验的佣兵团伙
who were experimenting with biological weaponry.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.250

10:23.970 --> 10:27.590
车臣  2013年  起义军发生内乱
Chechnya, 2013. Insurgents turned on one another.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.200
显然是这群佣兵所为
Indisputably the work of our mercenaries

10:29.210 --> 10:31.600
但未发现任何化学物质的痕迹
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.080
兰斯洛特是怎么回事
So what happened to Lancelot?

10:33.670 --> 10:36.860
他追查到了该团伙在阿根廷的一处房产
He tracked them to this property in Argentina.

10:36.860 --> 10:38.170
监视过程中
While he had them under survelillance

10:38.170 --> 10:40.580
他发现他们绑架了一名人质
he became awared that they'd effected a kidnapping.

10:41.060 --> 10:44.040
便进行单人营救  但是失败了
So he excuted a solo rescue mission which failed.

10:45.330 --> 10:48.910
被绑架人质为詹姆斯·阿诺德教授

10:45.900 --> 10:47.560
这是他发送的最后一条信息
This is his last transmission.

10:49.220 --> 10:51.890
-这人是谁  -一个气候变化末日论者
- Who is he? - Some climate change doom-sayer

10:51.890 --> 10:53.610
正在研究所谓的盖亚理论
experimenting on something called Gaia theory

10:53.610 --> 10:55.480
说地球能自我修复什么的
about the world healing itself or some such.

10:55.480 --> 10:59.240
奇怪的是  他并没有失踪
But what's curious is he's not actually missing.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.510
这位就是阿诺德教授
This is Professor Arnold,

11:02.680 --> 11:04.580
今早在帝国理工现身了
at Imperial College this morning.

11:05.610 --> 11:06.990
交给你了
It's all yours.

11:07.650 --> 11:10.030
别忘了找候选人的事
And don't forget your membership proposal.

11:10.030 --> 11:13.280
这次记得找个像样点的
Try picking a more suitable candidate this time.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.830
17年过去了
17 years

11:14.830 --> 11:16.240
你还是不明白
and still evolving with the time

11:16.250 --> 11:19.010
与时俱进是什么意思
remains an entirely foreign concept to you.

11:19.010 --> 11:20.230
别忘了  多亏了那位年轻人
Need I remind you I wouldn't be here

11:20.230 --> 11:21.610
我才能坐在这里
if it weren't for that young man?

11:22.340 --> 11:24.710
他不比其他候选人差多少
He was as much Kingsman material as any of them.

11:25.050 --> 11:25.980
甚至更优秀
More so.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.480
但他和我们并不是一类人
But he wasn't exactly one of us, was he?

11:30.350 --> 11:34.350
别嘴硬了  加拉哈德  你的小实验失败了
Let's face it Galahad, your little experiment failed.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.390
并非冒犯  亚瑟  你太高高在上了
With respect, Arthur. You're a snob.

11:38.390 --> 11:39.520
这不是冒犯吗
With respect?

11:40.560 --> 11:42.160
世界正在改变
The world is changing.

11:42.940 --> 11:45.850
贵族们的天赋越来越差是有原因的
There's a reason why aristocrats developed weak chins.

12:05.660 --> 12:06.620
艾格西
Eggsy?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.390
艾格西  快过来

-有烟纸吗  亲爱的  -没有
- Got any Rizla babe? - No.

12:15.610 --> 12:16.710
帮你老妈一个忙
Why don't you do your mama a favour

12:16.710 --> 12:17.810
下楼买点回来
and go down the shop and get some?

12:17.810 --> 12:18.590
自己买去
Get them yourself.

12:18.590 --> 12:21.650
我跟你说过  别用这种口气和迪恩讲话
What have I said to you about speaking to Dean like that?

12:22.380 --> 12:25.200
三个人多挤  让迪恩的哈巴狗去
Three's a crowd, isn't it? Why don't Dean's Poodle go?

12:25.800 --> 12:26.830
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.330
你拿着钱  去买点烟纸
Why don't you take this and go get some Rizlas,

12:29.330 --> 12:30.600
再给自己买点糖
get yourself some sweets.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.950
你走了之后
And while you're gone,

12:32.390 --> 12:34.860
我让你妈体会体会三个人挤不挤
we'll show your mother how three can be a good company.

12:37.990 --> 12:38.880
谢谢  亲爱的

Come here.

12:46.590 --> 12:47.820

There we go.

12:49.430 --> 12:50.520
开心吧
Is that better?

13:05.400 --> 13:07.850
迪恩对你老妈这么差  为什么不分手
If Dean treats your mum so bad, why don't she leave him?

13:07.850 --> 13:09.900
缺乏自尊  这就是问题所在
Low self-esteem, that's her problem.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.810
瞎扯  她怎么可能没自尊呢
Fuck off. Why would she have low self-esteem, mate?

13:11.810 --> 13:13.380
看他老妈那身材
Eggsy's mom is well fit.

13:13.780 --> 13:14.940
-天哪  -没别的意思  哥们
- Jesus. - No offence, pal.

13:14.950 --> 13:15.830
没关系
That's all right.

13:17.210 --> 13:19.590
总有一天  我要打烂他的脸
One of these days I'm gonna smash his face in.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.300
你脑子坏了吗
Are you mental, cuz?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.920
他会让那帮家伙扁你一顿
He just get that lot to do you,

13:22.920 --> 13:24.540
然后假装自己什么都...
and then pretend he knew nothing...

13:26.060 --> 13:26.980
不知道
...about it.

13:26.980 --> 13:30.080
你们以为我们老大在泡艾格西的老妈
Oi, you think you can chat shit about us and we won't do nothing,

13:30.080 --> 13:32.660
你们就可以嘴里喷粪了吗
just 'cause our governor's banging Eggsy's mum?

13:32.660 --> 13:34.580
是啊  没错
Pretty much, yeah.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.870
惹他干嘛  赶紧走  不值得的
Well, just leave it. Let's just go, man. It's not worth it.

13:37.870 --> 13:39.750
这里不欢迎你们了

这么冷  干嘛要走路
It's freezing. Why are we walking?

你他妈顺了他的车钥匙
You jacked his fucking car keys, bruv?

14:03.230 --> 14:05.450
是啊  还要顺他的车呢
Yeah. Now we're gonna nick his car.

14:06.050 --> 14:08.030
-天哪  -要死  快上车
- Fucking hell. - Shit, move!

14:13.630 --> 14:14.870
等着  兄弟们
Hold on, boys.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.500
那他妈的是我的车
Oi, that's my fucking car!

14:21.040 --> 14:23.810

14:27.550 --> 14:28.850
说什么  听不见

Floor it, Eggsy!

14:39.300 --> 14:40.450
王八蛋
Wanker!

14:42.230 --> 14:43.910
迪恩  是我
Yeah, Dean. Look, it's me.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.050
艾格西他妈的偷了我的车
Eggsy just stole my fucking car, yeah.

14:46.090 --> 14:46.850
我刚从酒吧出来
Yeah. I've come out of the pub

14:46.850 --> 14:49.140
他当着我的面  原地转了有15圈
and he's done about 15 donuts in my fucking face

14:49.140 --> 14:50.330
然后开走了
and he's drove off.

14:50.870 --> 14:53.070
我弄不回来  他藐视我
No, I can't have it. Look, he disrespecting me,

14:53.080 --> 14:55.080
等于是藐视你
and that means he's disrespecting you...

14:55.530 --> 14:57.070
等等  搞什么
Hold, hold, hold up, what the...?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.220

我来搞定  快下车
I'll sort this. Get outta the car.

15:50.230 --> 15:51.960
快他妈下车啊
I said, get out of the fucking car!

16:00.760 --> 16:04.410
艾格西  做了贼就别想着荣誉感了
Eggsy, there is no such thing as honour amongst thieves.

16:05.150 --> 16:07.060
你要么乖乖
Now you can start giving me some names

16:07.060 --> 16:08.900
供出小伙伴的名字
of the boys you were with,

16:09.560 --> 16:11.010
要么一个人坐牢
or you go down.

16:11.750 --> 16:12.640
自己选吧
It's up to you.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.190
我要打个电话  我有这个权利
I want to exercise my right to a phone call.

16:18.790 --> 16:22.310
最好是打给你老妈
Well, I hope it's to your mum.

16:22.310 --> 16:25.140
告诉她  你要18个月后才能回家吃晚饭
To tell her you're gonna be 18 months late for your dinner.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.750

我叫艾格西·安温  抱歉  是加里·安温

17:03.690 --> 17:07.610
我遇上麻烦了  现在人在霍尔本警察局
And, I'm up shit creek, I'm in Holborn police station.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.420
我妈妈说需要帮助时可以拨这个号
And my mum said to call this number if ever I needed help...

17:09.420 --> 17:11.780
抱歉  先生  您打错了
Sorry, sir. Wrong number.

17:12.130 --> 17:13.260
等等
Wait, wait.

17:15.140 --> 17:16.870
牛津鞋  不雕花

我  好的
I...yeah.

17:43.860 --> 17:45.940
好的  我完全理解
Yes, I totally understand.

18:05.820 --> 18:06.700
艾格西
Eggsy.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.600
要搭车回家吗
Would you like a lift home?

18:10.120 --> 18:12.750
-你是谁  -把你弄出来的人
- Who are you? - The man who got you released.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.000
这不算回答
That ain't an answer.

18:14.570 --> 18:16.390
说声谢谢很难吗
A little gratitude would be nice.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.370
我叫哈利·哈特
My name is Harry Hart,

18:20.160 --> 18:21.740
那枚勋章是我给你的
and I gave you that medal.

18:22.780 --> 18:24.490
你父亲救过我一命
Your father saved my life.

18:27.980 --> 18:30.410
这么说  当裁缝之前你当过兵
So before you was a tailor you was in the army?

18:30.760 --> 18:33.290
-是军官吗  -并不算
- Like an officer? - Not quite.

18:33.860 --> 18:35.790
你在哪儿服役  伊拉克之类的吗
So where were you posted, Iraq or something?

18:35.790 --> 18:37.780
抱歉  艾格西  这是机密
Sorry, Eggsy, classified.

18:39.110 --> 18:40.900
但我老爸救过你的命  对吧
But my dad saved your life, eh?

18:41.800 --> 18:45.020
你父亲牺牲的那天  是我的疏漏
The day your father died, I missed something.

18:46.370 --> 18:47.410
要不是他挺身而出
And if it weren't for his courage,

18:47.410 --> 18:50.240
我的疏漏会让所有在场的人丧命
my mistake would have cost the lives of every man present.

18:51.570 --> 18:52.660
所以我欠他的
So I owe him.

18:54.260 --> 18:58.470
你父亲很勇敢  是个好人
Your father was a brave man, a good man.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.540
我读过你的档案
And having read your files,

19:00.540 --> 19:03.040
你的某些选择会让他很失望吧
I think he'd be bitterly disappointed in the choices you've made.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.460
你没资格对我评头论足
You can't talk to me like that.

19:04.460 --> 19:07.240
智商超群  小学时期表现优异
Huge IQ, great performance at primary school.

19:08.390 --> 19:09.800
之后却越走越歪
And then it all went tits up.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.520
毒品  小偷小摸  从未有过像样的工作
Drugs, petty crime, never had a job.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.490
你以为现在工作很好找吗
Well, you think there's a lot of job going around here, do you?

19:14.490 --> 19:16.280
那也不能说明你为什么放弃了爱好
Doesn't explain why you gave up your hobbies.

19:16.280 --> 19:20.350
连续两年获得地区10岁以下组体操冠军
First prize, regional under 10 gymnastics, two years in a row.

19:20.350 --> 19:22.640
你的教练本想培养你去奥运会
Your coach had you picked as Olympic team material.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.590
要是碰上像我继父那样的人
Yeah, well, when you grow up around someone like my stepdad,

19:24.600 --> 19:25.960
很快就会沾染上别的爱好
you pick up new hobbies pretty quickly.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.380
当然  总是别人的错
Of course. Always someone else's fault.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.560
那你从海军陆战队退出又怪谁呢
Who's to blame for you quitting the marines?

19:31.560 --> 19:32.460
训练已经过半
You're halfway through training,

19:32.460 --> 19:33.960
表现优异  你却放弃了
doing brilliantly but you gave up.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.740
因为我妈妈快要疯了
Because my mum went mental.

19:36.210 --> 19:38.720
天天说会像失去老爸一样失去我
Banging on about losing me as well as my dad,

19:39.220 --> 19:41.670
不想让我给你们这群老爷当炮灰
didn't want me being cannon fodder for snobs like you,

19:41.680 --> 19:44.120
高高在上  对我们指手画脚
judging people like me from your ivory towers,

19:44.120 --> 19:46.550
却不想想我们的苦衷
with no thought about why we do what we do.

19:46.980 --> 19:49.360
我们也没得选  懂吗
We ain't got much choice, you get me?

19:50.040 --> 19:52.560
如果能有好命  屁股插着金汤勺出生
And if we was born with the same silver spoons up our arses,

19:52.560 --> 19:54.110
我们绝不比你们差
we'd do just as well as you,

19:54.700 --> 19:55.650
只会更优秀
if not better.

19:55.650 --> 19:59.000
你他妈在这干什么  想找事吗
What the fuck you doing here? You taking a piss?

20:00.240 --> 20:01.310
活生生的例子来了
Some more examples of young men

20:01.310 --> 20:03.340
我看他们也只需要插个金汤勺
who simply need a silver suppository.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.110
不  他们是例外  走吧
No, they are exceptions, come on.

20:05.110 --> 20:06.590
胡扯  酒还没喝完呢
Nonsense. We haven't finished our drinks.

20:06.590 --> 20:09.160
因为你偷了他的车  迪恩说不用再留情
After you nicked his car, Dean says you're fair guy,

20:09.160 --> 20:10.870
他也不会再听你老妈的求情了
and he ain't give a shit what your mum says.

20:10.870 --> 20:12.610
小伙子们
Listen, boys.

20:13.830 --> 20:15.880
我今天情绪波动很大
I've had a rather emotional day,

20:15.880 --> 20:17.880
不管你们和艾格西有什么过节
so whatever your beef with Eggsy is,

20:17.880 --> 20:19.860
这孩子大概是有错在先
and I'm sure it's well founded,

20:20.660 --> 20:24.000
我只希望你们能让我们单独待会
I'd appreciate it enormously if you could just leave us in peace,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.320
让我喝完这杯吉尼斯  谢谢
until I finish this lovely pint of Guinness.

20:30.170 --> 20:33.050
你最好闪远点  老爷爷  拳头不认人
You should get out of way, granddaddy, you'll get hurt and all.

20:33.050 --> 20:34.590
他不是开玩笑的  你走吧
He ain't joking, you should go.

20:41.120 --> 20:41.930
借过
Excuse me.

20:44.190 --> 20:45.360
再想找小鲜肉玩
You looking for another rent boy,

20:45.360 --> 20:47.280
去史密斯街的街角
they're on the corner of Smith Street.

20:52.770 --> 20:53.860
明礼

20:55.180 --> 20:56.170
方能

21:08.400 --> 21:09.630
你们知道这句话的意思吗
Do you know what that means?

21:12.130 --> 21:13.720
那我来教教你们吧
Then let me teach you a lesson.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.040
你们是想傻站一天
Are we gonna stand around here all day,

21:25.360 --> 21:26.450
还是想打一架
or are we going to fight?

22:10.840 --> 22:14.150
你个王八蛋  你他妈...
You fucking bastard, you fucking dirty...

22:16.560 --> 22:16.770
击昏

22:16.770 --> 22:17.020
击昏

22:27.440 --> 22:28.490
失忆

22:55.070 --> 22:56.200
抱歉
Sorry about that.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.510
我需要发泄一下
Needed to let off a little steam.

22:59.570 --> 23:01.480
一个朋友昨天死了
Yesterday a friend of mine died.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.250
他也认识你父亲
He knew your father too, actually.

23:07.860 --> 23:09.770
我很抱歉  艾格西
Now, I do apologize, Eggsy.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.050
我不该在你面前做这些
I shouldn't have done this in front of you.

23:12.340 --> 23:14.380
不  求你了  我发誓一个字也不说
No, please. I won't say nothing, I swear.

23:14.390 --> 23:16.030
我最擅长保守秘密了
If there's one thing I can do, it's keep my mouth shut.

23:16.030 --> 23:16.980
谁也不说吗
You won't tell a soul?

23:16.980 --> 23:18.740
你可以问条子  我从没出卖过人
Ask the feds. I've never grassed anyone out.

23:18.740 --> 23:20.570
-你发誓  -用生命担保
- Is that a promise? - On my life.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.800
非常感谢  艾格西
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

23:27.310 --> 23:28.960
你说得对  老爷们是高高在上
You're right about the snobs.

23:29.310 --> 23:32.040
但他们中也有例外
But there too, there are exceptions.

23:32.410 --> 23:33.890
祝你好运
Best of luck with everything.

23:48.580 --> 23:49.580

24:47.560 --> 24:48.970
我现在就可以宰了你
I could kill you right now,

24:48.970 --> 24:51.680
整个世上都没人知道
and no one in the whole world will know it!

24:51.680 --> 24:52.720
但我知道
But I will.

24:53.580 --> 24:55.540
我现在掌握了充分的证据
I have enough evidence on your activities

24:55.540 --> 24:57.650
足以让你坐一辈子牢

24:57.650 --> 24:59.290
迪恩·安东尼·培根先生
Mr. Dean Anthony Bacon.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.060
搞什么鬼
What the fuck?

25:00.060 --> 25:01.620
所以你最好放开小伙子
So I suggest you leave the boy alone

25:01.620 --> 25:02.950
不然我将不得不
or I shall be forced to

25:02.950 --> 25:05.290
把你的所作所为报告给相关部门
deliver it to the appropriate authorities.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.140
艾格西  去我跟你说的那个定制店找我
Eggsy, meet me at the tailor I told you about.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.560
这他妈怎么回事
What the fuck's going on here?

艾格西  你个混蛋
Eggsy, you fucking maggot!

25:15.060 --> 25:19.990

王牌定制

26:01.860 --> 26:03.740
虽然我没见过裁缝
I've never met a tailor before,

26:04.760 --> 26:06.110
但你肯定不是裁缝
but I know you ain't one.

26:10.030 --> 26:10.880
跟我来
Come with me.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.180
进来
Come on in.

你看见了什么
What do you see?

26:28.740 --> 26:31.510
完全不知道这是怎么回事的人
Someone who wants to know what the fuck is going on.

26:40.190 --> 26:41.610
能够信守承诺
who can do as he's asked,

26:42.140 --> 26:44.330
这辈子想做点好事
and who wants to do something good with his life.

26:46.460 --> 26:48.110
你看过《颠倒乾坤》吗
Have you seen the film "Trading Places"?

26:49.220 --> 26:50.070
没有
No.

26:50.940 --> 26:52.080
那《尼基塔》呢
How about "Nikita"?

26:53.520 --> 26:54.450
《风月俏佳人》呢
"Pretty Woman"?

26:55.730 --> 26:56.580
好吧
All right.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.160
我想说的是
My point is, the lack of

26:58.160 --> 27:00.120
出身不好是限制了你的发展
a silver spoon had set you on a certain path

27:00.120 --> 27:01.660
但你可以主动改变
but you needn't stay on it.

27:02.390 --> 27:07.020
准备好去适应  去学习  你会有成就的
If you're prepared to adapt and learn, you can transform.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.170
就像《窈窕淑女》那样
Like in "My Fair Lady"?

27:10.590 --> 27:12.230
你还总是能给人惊喜
Well, you're full of surprises.

27:12.900 --> 27:15.290
对  就像《窈窕淑女》那样
Yes, like "My Fair Lady".

27:16.660 --> 27:17.270
现在呢
And in this case

27:17.270 --> 27:19.920
我给你一个加入我们的机会
I'm offering you the opportunity to become a Kingsman.

27:20.610 --> 27:21.610
做裁缝吗
A tailor?

27:22.480 --> 27:23.910
王牌特工
A Kingsman agent.

27:25.370 --> 27:26.550
间谍吗
Like a spy?

27:26.820 --> 27:27.770
类似
Of sorts.

27:29.920 --> 27:30.830
有兴趣吗
Interested?

27:31.480 --> 27:33.150
我还有什么可顾忌的吗
You think I've got anything to lose?

27:40.950 --> 27:42.230
自1849年起
Since 1849,

27:42.240 --> 27:46.580
王牌定制为全世界最有权势的人定制服装
Kingsman tailors clothed the world's most powerful individuals.

27:46.580 --> 27:47.590

By 1919,

27:47.590 --> 27:50.700
他们中的许多人在一战中失去了子嗣
a great number of them had lost their heirs to World War I.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.850
导致大量财富无人继承
That meant a lot of money going uninherited,

27:55.680 --> 27:56.650
许多有权势的人
and a lot of powerful men

27:56.650 --> 27:59.760
想站出来维护和平  拯救生命
with the desire to preserve peace and protect life.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.970
我们的创建者意识到
Our founders realized

28:00.970 --> 28:03.970
他们可以用财富和影响力造福世人
that they can channel that wealth and influence for greater good.

28:04.740 --> 28:07.770
于是我们开始了另一项事业

28:15.380 --> 28:16.920
不受政治和官僚的约束
Above the politics and bureaucracy

28:16.920 --> 28:20.820
不然就成了政府的情报部门  毫无节操

西装是现代绅士的盔甲
A suit is a modern gentleman's armour.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.960
而王牌特工就是当代的骑士
And the Kingsman agents are the new knights.

28:29.420 --> 28:32.090

- How deep does this fucking thing go? - Deep enough.

29:16.810 --> 29:18.020
该死  我们迟到了
Shit. We're late.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.470
你父亲当年也是这个表情
Your father had the same look on his face.

29:47.370 --> 29:48.330
我也是
As did I.

29:50.370 --> 29:50.880
过来吧
Come on.

30:19.410 --> 30:20.580
你们马上要参加
You are about to embark on

30:20.580 --> 30:24.090
很有可能是世界上最危险的面试
what's probably the most dangerous job interview in the world.

30:24.090 --> 30:29.090
有且只有一人能成为下一任兰斯洛特
One of you, and only one of you will become the next Lancelot.

30:29.860 --> 30:33.390
谁能告诉我这是什么
Can anybody tell me what this is?

30:34.090 --> 30:35.670
-你来说  -收尸袋  长官
- Yes? - Bodybag, sir.

30:35.670 --> 30:36.750
正确

30:37.460 --> 30:38.320
查理  对吧
Charlie, isn't it?

30:38.320 --> 30:39.790
-是的  长官  -很好
- Yes, sir. - Good.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.430
过一会儿  你们每人都过来拿一个
In a moment, you'll each collect a bodybag.

30:42.430 --> 30:44.860
你们要写上自己的名字
You will write your name on that bag,

30:44.860 --> 30:48.260
以及你们最近亲属的详细信息
you will write the details of your next of kin on that bag.

30:48.260 --> 30:51.900
这表示你们愿意承担接下来的风险
This represents your acknowledgement of the risks that you're about to face

30:51.910 --> 30:54.870
也同意遵守严格的保密协议
as well as your agreement to strict confidentiality,

30:54.870 --> 30:57.170
你们要是有人泄密
which, incidentally, if you break,

30:57.170 --> 30:59.860
就会跟那位亲属一起
will result in you and your next of kin

30:59.860 --> 31:02.740
进袋子里
being in that bag.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.750
明白了吗
Is that understood?

31:07.480 --> 31:08.370
很好
Excellent.

31:09.290 --> 31:10.190
解散
Fall out.

31:17.870 --> 31:20.500
我是罗克茜安  叫我罗克茜就行
Roxanne, but call me Roxy.

31:21.090 --> 31:22.490

- I'm Eggsy. - Eggy?

31:22.490 --> 31:24.530
-不  艾格西  -蛋蛋
- No. Eggsy. - Eggy.

31:24.980 --> 31:26.480
他们从哪把你挖出来的
Where did they dig you up?

31:26.480 --> 31:28.830
你该知道不能讨论推荐人的吧
You know we're not allowed to discuss who proposed us.

31:28.830 --> 31:30.250
别这么激动
No need to bite his head off.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.430
查理只是想随便聊聊  对吧  查理
Charlie's only making conversation, right, Charlie?

31:33.130 --> 31:34.070
我是迪格比
I'm Digby.

31:35.790 --> 31:37.880
-迪格比  -蛋蛋  这是鲁夫斯
- Digby. - Eggy, this is Rufus.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.110
鲁夫斯  蛋蛋
Rufus, Eggy.

31:41.880 --> 31:45.840
-你是牛津的还是剑桥的  -都不是
- So, Eggy, are you Oxford or Cambridge? - Neither.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.390
-圣安德鲁斯的  -杜伦的
- St. Andrews? - Durham?

31:47.390 --> 31:49.470
等等  我们是不是见过
Oh, wait, I think we may have met.

31:49.480 --> 31:53.200
在温彻斯特服务站的麦当劳  是你帮我点的餐吗
Did you serve me at the McDonald's in Winchester service station?

31:53.420 --> 31:54.400
没有
No.

31:54.410 --> 31:55.670
要真是我  我一定给你
But if I had, I'd give you an extra

31:55.670 --> 31:57.120
撸点秘制酱料
and open the secret sauce.

31:57.570 --> 31:58.980
绝对是圣安德鲁斯的
He's definitely St. Andrews.

32:00.810 --> 32:01.860
别理他们
Just ignore them.

32:01.860 --> 32:04.080
-你要笔吗  -谢谢
- You need a pen? - Cheers.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.720
阿米莉亚  对吗
Amelia, isn't it?

32:05.720 --> 32:07.320
阿米莉亚  艾格西
Amelia, Eggsy.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.250
你好  艾格西
Hi, Eggsy.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.720
别理那些家伙
Don't take any notice of those guys.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.360
我也是这么说的
That's what I told him.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.700
姓名
血型
最近亲属

32:14.540 --> 32:18.140
唬人的把戏  军队惯用伎俩
It's just scare tactics. Classic army technique.

32:18.140 --> 32:19.350
不会有人死的
No one's gonna die.

32:23.290 --> 32:24.140
真可惜
Shame.

32:26.630 --> 32:29.050
真棒  你不知道  中情局也不知道
Great. You don't know, the CIA don't know.

32:29.050 --> 32:31.750
没人知道这家伙是谁吗
Nobody knows who this guy is?

32:32.260 --> 32:32.940
没事
Fine.

32:33.430 --> 32:34.970
说真的  没事
Seriously, that's fine.

32:34.970 --> 32:38.800
当然不是真的没事  但我不是为这个来的
Well, it's not really fine, but it's not why I'm here.

32:39.120 --> 32:42.620
哥们  你了解我的  我不在乎钱
Hell, man. You know me. Money's not my issue.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.450
我离开麻省理工的时候就可以退休
I could've retire straight out of MIT,

32:44.450 --> 32:47.170
找个岛逍遥自在  让生意自己运转
fuck off to some island, let the business run itself.

32:47.170 --> 32:51.820
没人要我拯救地球  是我自己想
Nobody told me to try and save the planet, I wanted to.

32:51.820 --> 32:53.870
研究气候变化  游说政客
Climate change research, lobbying,

32:53.880 --> 32:55.770
钻研多年  不断砸钱...
years of study, billions of dollars...

32:55.770 --> 32:57.260
但你知道我为什么退出吗
and you know why I quit?

32:58.040 --> 33:00.310
因为我没看错的话
Because the last time I checked,

33:00.310 --> 33:02.770
地球依然是一塌糊涂
the planet was still fucked.

33:03.180 --> 33:05.370
因此我顿悟了
Hence, my epiphany.

33:05.850 --> 33:08.870
钱解决不了问题
Money won't solve this.

33:08.870 --> 33:11.440
那些自称为政客的蠢货们
Those idiots who call themselves politicians

33:11.440 --> 33:13.120
只会把头埋进沙子
had buried their heads in the sand

33:13.120 --> 33:15.300
毫无作为  只在乎连任
and stood for nothing but reelection.

33:16.380 --> 33:20.740
所以我花了两年  寻找真正的解决方法
So I spent the last two years trying to find the real solution.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.170
我找到了
And I found it.

33:24.290 --> 33:27.570
如果你想知道如何让世界更美好
Now, if you really wanna make the world a better place,

33:27.570 --> 33:29.950
那最好洗耳恭听
I suggest you open your fucking ears,

33:29.950 --> 33:31.700
因为我现在就要告诉你
because I'm about to tell it to you.

33:32.320 --> 33:35.560
说吧  瓦伦丁先生  我洗耳恭听
Go on, Mr. Valentine. I'm still listening.

33:36.660 --> 33:40.300
只要你同意我提出的所有条款
As long as you agree to all my terms.

34:28.720 --> 34:31.720
别紧张  听我说  保持冷静
No one panic. Listen to me. Stay calm.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.030
该死
Fuck.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.050
用马桶通气  马桶通气
Loo snorkels, loo snorkels.

34:37.050 --> 34:39.360
-什么玩意  -用淋浴喷头
- Loo snorkels? - Shower heads!

34:40.500 --> 34:43.010
-淋浴喷头  -她说的对  快  快
- Shower heads? - She's right. Go, fucking go!

34:44.430 --> 34:46.840
等等  为什么不直接开门
Hang about, what's wrong with the fucking door?

36:10.810 --> 36:13.770
恭喜你们完成了第一个任务
Congratulations on completing your first task.

36:13.770 --> 36:16.320
查理  罗克茜  好样的
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.600
顺便提醒一下仍然一头雾水的人
For those of you who are still confused,

36:18.600 --> 36:20.880
拿根软管穿过马桶的U型弯
if you can get a breathing tube around the U-bend of a toilet,

36:20.890 --> 36:22.900
就能呼吸到无限的空气
you have an unlimited air supply.

36:22.900 --> 36:25.440
简单的物理学知识  值得铭记
Simple physics, worth remembering.

36:25.450 --> 36:28.900
艾格西  恭喜你发现了这是双面镜
Eggsy, well done for spotting that was a two-way mirror.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.070
可能因为他见的太多了
He's probably seen enough of them.

36:30.070 --> 36:33.220
好了  没什么可笑的
Yeah, you can all wipe those smirks off your faces.

36:33.220 --> 36:34.610
因为在我这里
Because as far as I'm concerned,

36:34.610 --> 36:37.460
你们全都不及格
every single one of you has failed.

36:37.460 --> 36:40.630
你们全都忘记了最重要的事情
You all forgot the most important thing.

36:41.450 --> 36:42.570
团队合作
Teamwork.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.340
看来是玩真的啊
So much for classic army technique.

37:02.770 --> 37:08.740
35  105  没错  就是这样
35, 105. That's it. That's it.

37:13.610 --> 37:14.590
你好
Hello.

37:15.110 --> 37:16.340
需要帮忙吗
Can I help you?

37:16.340 --> 37:20.190
是的  我想咨询一下人类对地球的影响
Yes, I have a question about anthropogenic force.

37:21.450 --> 37:24.670
真的吗  这事可有意思了
Really? Well, it's actually quite fascinating.

37:26.180 --> 37:27.860
我的同事为了救你牺牲了
My colleague died trying to rescue you,

37:27.870 --> 37:29.610
我相信你也看到了他有多厉害
and I'm sure you saw how well-trained he was,

37:29.610 --> 37:31.330
所以你最好告诉我是谁绑架了你
so I suggest you tell me who kidnapped you

37:31.330 --> 37:32.620
为什么又放你走
and why they let you go?

37:32.620 --> 37:34.750
我不知道...
I have no idea what...

37:34.750 --> 37:37.230
我不能说  他说这是...
I'm not supposed to say, he said it was...

37:37.650 --> 37:39.580
我的老天  我都没使劲儿
Oh, for God's sake, I barely touched you.

37:39.580 --> 37:40.610
你怎么这么...
Oh, man up...

37:59.170 --> 38:03.510
植入设备已激活

38:01.800 --> 38:04.020
这个王八蛋  不管他是谁  我都...
Fuck that guy, whoever he is, I'm gonna...

38:05.420 --> 38:07.360
竟然逼我杀了阿诺德教授
Made me kill Professor Arnold.

38:07.360 --> 38:08.910
我他妈爱死阿诺德教授了
I goddamn love Professor Arnold.

38:08.910 --> 38:09.840
好消息是
Well, the good news is,

38:09.840 --> 38:12.010
我们知道了应急和监控系统运行良好
we know the emergency and surveillance system works.

38:12.010 --> 38:13.840
你知道什么不是好消息吗
You know what's not good news?

38:14.250 --> 38:17.600
"我的同事牺牲了"  他这么说的
"My colleague died", that's what he said.

38:17.600 --> 38:20.230
这是个组织  他们现在盯上咱们了
This is an organisation and they're all over us.

38:20.230 --> 38:22.110
-你跟哪些机构联系了  -我说了
- Whoever you spoke to...- I told you,

38:22.110 --> 38:24.110
我联系了克格勃  军情六处
I made contact with the KGB, MI6,

38:24.110 --> 38:26.020
摩萨德和北京
Mossad and Beijing.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.640
都坚称不是他们的人
They all insist he wasn't one of theirs.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.910
北京
Beijing.

38:29.530 --> 38:31.790
中国的秘密情报局连个特别点的名字都没有
So freaky how there's no recognizable name

38:31.790 --> 38:33.540
想想就害怕
for the Chinese Secret Service.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.500
不过那才叫秘密  对吧
Now that's what you call a secret, right?

38:37.320 --> 38:39.500
这样  让他们去死吧
You know what? Fuck it.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.250
我们必须加快速度
We need to speed things up.

38:41.250 --> 38:42.670
提前发布产品
Bring the product release forward.

38:42.670 --> 38:44.720
可还没完成大规模生产
We're only halfway into production,

38:44.720 --> 38:46.420
加速是要多花钱的
and speeding it will cost a fortune.

38:46.420 --> 38:49.170
你觉得我在乎吗  照我说的做
Do I look like I give a fuck? Just get it done!

38:52.300 --> 38:54.880
你们昨晚应该已经意识到了
As some of you would have learnt last night,

38:56.230 --> 38:59.300
对于王牌特工来说  团队合作至关重要
teamwork is paramount here at a Kingsman.

38:59.300 --> 39:02.610
为了强化你们的技能  测试你们的极限
We're here to enhance your skills, test you to your limits,

39:03.640 --> 39:07.040
你们必须每人选只小狗
which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.

39:07.330 --> 39:09.330
你们去哪儿  狗就去哪儿
Wherever you go, your dog goes.

39:09.330 --> 39:11.550
你们要照顾它  训练它
You will care for it, you will teach it.

39:11.550 --> 39:14.600
把它们训练好  你们也就快了
And by the time it's fully trained, so will you be.

39:14.890 --> 39:17.050
当然得保证不被淘汰
Those of you who're still here, that is.

39:17.490 --> 39:18.770
明白了吗
Do you understand?

39:19.680 --> 39:20.840
挑一只吧
Choose your puppy.

39:24.310 --> 39:25.350
贵宾犬
A poodle?

39:25.720 --> 39:28.390
怎么了  他们是猎犬
What? They're gundogs.

39:28.390 --> 39:31.270
最古老的犬类了  容易训练
Oldest barking breed, easy to train.

39:32.900 --> 39:33.910
哈巴狗
A pug?

39:35.610 --> 39:36.810
这是斗牛犬吧
It's a bulldog, ain't it?

39:39.740 --> 39:41.220
但它会长大的对不对
It'll get bigger, though, won't it?

39:44.700 --> 39:46.560
该死的
Shit.

39:49.100 --> 39:52.040
从磁共振成像来看  没有脑震荡的迹象
His MRI shows no signs of concussion.

39:52.650 --> 39:55.170
头部也无明显外伤
No direct brain trauma at all.

39:55.820 --> 39:57.800
要多久才能下床活动
How much longer can he be out?

39:58.110 --> 39:59.520
这个问得好
That's the million dollar question.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.460
我们不清楚他到底沾上了什么东西
We don't know what he was exposed to in there.

40:01.460 --> 40:02.960
那哈利的录像呢
What about Harry's footage,

40:02.960 --> 40:04.790
没有传送回终端吗
it didn't stream to his home terminal?

40:04.790 --> 40:07.280
严格加密且无法破解
Encrypted and uncrackable.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.130
所以等他醒了以后
If and when he comes around,

40:09.130 --> 40:12.080
你最好请他分享一下密码
you might wanna have a word with him about sharing his password.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.440
他会好起来的吧
Is he gonna be all right?

40:15.040 --> 40:17.120
要耐心点  艾格西
We need to have patience, Eggsy.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.960
但希望还是有的
But there's hope, okay?

40:18.960 --> 40:20.930
我是你的话就会全心投入训练
If I were you, I'll concentrate on your training,

40:20.930 --> 40:23.360
顺利通过所有测试  让他为你自豪
make it through the test, make him proud.

40:30.650 --> 40:32.270
走啊  走啊
Come on, come on!

40:32.270 --> 40:34.040
JB  动起来  动起来
JB, come on, come on!

40:37.570 --> 40:39.280
我可不想因为你而垫底
I'm not coming last 'cause of you.

40:40.390 --> 40:43.390
JB  再不走信不信我他妈毙了你
JB, I'll shoot you, got me? I'll fucking shoot you.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.070
梅林不允许我抱着你走
Merlin said we're not allowed to hold you.

40:47.960 --> 40:48.920
管他呢
Bollocks.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.020
又进水了
Water!

41:36.220 --> 41:37.610
-想打架  -算了  艾格西
- Come on, eh? - Eggsy, forget it!

41:37.610 --> 41:39.330
怎么了  这么开不起玩笑
Oh, what's wrong, mate? You can't take a joke?

41:39.330 --> 41:41.710
打架会被淘汰的  你这么做不值当
Seriously, you'll get thrown out and it's just not worth it.

41:41.720 --> 41:43.380
我他妈才不在乎淘不淘汰
Maybe I don't give a fuck about get kicked out!

41:43.380 --> 41:44.940
那动手啊  你个下等人
Do it. Come on, you pleb.

41:44.940 --> 41:47.140
查理  滚一边去
Charlie, fuck off!

41:48.650 --> 41:50.060
滚开  少来惹我
Yeah, go on. Walk away.

41:51.060 --> 41:51.980
神经病
Dickhead.

你们有一小时完成测试
You have exactly one hour to complete the test,

42:11.510 --> 42:12.580
计时开始

42:15.250 --> 42:16.970
前方八百米  发现新目标
New target, 800 metres.

42:16.970 --> 42:18.880
真不敢相信你居然还赖在这
Yeah. It's unbelievable. You're still here,

42:18.880 --> 42:22.590
跟一坨屎一样  冲都冲不走
lingering like some big steaming shit that just won't flush.

42:22.590 --> 42:24.230
收到  目标已确认
Roger that.Target identified

42:24.240 --> 42:26.400
你他妈就不能闭嘴吗
and how about you shut the fuck up?

42:26.400 --> 42:28.680
确保少数族裔等弱势群体占有一定比例

42:26.400 --> 42:28.680
这就是所谓的平权法案吧
Positive discrimination, that's what it is.

42:29.470 --> 42:30.700
垃圾学校的学生成绩差得很
It's like these fucking state school kids

42:30.700 --> 42:32.410
但是照样能进牛津
who get into Oxford on C-grades,

42:32.740 --> 42:34.420
就因为他老妈是个瘸子同性恋
'cause their mum is a one-legged lesbian.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.040
你又不知道我成绩什么样
You don't know fuck all about my grades.

42:36.040 --> 42:38.160
抱歉  我相信你学历一定很高
Forgive me, I'm sure you're highly educated.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.240
准备好就开火吧

42:41.840 --> 42:44.230
你觉得我需要平权法案吗
How's that for positive discrimination?

42:56.500 --> 42:58.340
感谢二位的倾听
I want to thank you both for listening.

42:58.340 --> 43:01.720

43:08.320 --> 43:10.630
说真的  棒极了
It's absolutely brilliant.

43:11.580 --> 43:15.300
你就是个彻头彻尾的疯子
You are completely crazy.

43:26.190 --> 43:28.710
真是不好意思  公主殿下
Sorry, Your Royal Highness,

43:28.710 --> 43:29.890
要想恢复斯堪的纳维亚半岛秩序
but you got a big role to play

43:29.890 --> 43:32.910
您是不可缺少的一环
in getting the Scandinavian region back on track.

43:32.920 --> 43:34.350
您备受尊敬  鼓舞人心
You're popular, inspirational,

43:34.350 --> 43:36.990
还有强大的民众号召力
and you have the power to galvanize the people.

43:36.990 --> 43:39.950
所以不管您合不合作
Now whether you're on board or not,

43:39.950 --> 43:41.670
我都不得不坚持
I'm going to have to insist

43:41.680 --> 43:44.970
将您安置在安全的地方
on getting you somewhere I can ensure your safety.

43:45.270 --> 43:48.040
那您呢  首相  您要参与吗
How about you, Prime Minister? You in or out?

43:48.390 --> 43:51.240
身为一个政客  我觉得事到如今
Well, I think it's about time that a politician did something

43:51.250 --> 43:55.250
该干点有意义的事了
that actually made a difference.

43:55.250 --> 43:56.650
说得好
Too true.

43:57.250 --> 43:57.780
干嘛
What?

43:58.020 --> 43:59.230
把她带走
Take her away.

44:03.190 --> 44:04.070
喝一杯
Drink?

44:05.020 --> 44:05.890
好啊
Why not?

44:10.510 --> 44:13.330
别担心  公主不会受到任何伤害
Don't worry, no harm will come to the princess.

44:13.330 --> 44:15.090
反正我是共和党的[反王室]
Well, I am a republican anyway, so...

44:15.090 --> 44:17.510
我又不在乎
it really doesn't matter.

44:18.950 --> 44:20.350
放了公主
Release the princess.

44:53.740 --> 44:54.810
好了  完成了
Okay, you're done.

44:55.170 --> 44:56.360
感觉还行吧
Not so bad, right?

44:57.170 --> 44:58.800
根本没感觉
Hardly felt a thing.

44:59.250 --> 45:00.360
欢迎加入

45:01.240 --> 45:02.620

45:09.420 --> 45:10.640
没人教你进门要先敲门吗
Ever heard of knocking?

45:11.570 --> 45:13.560
我偷东西踩点时才会敲门
Only when I'm casing the place to rob.

45:14.510 --> 45:15.920
梅林说你找我
Merlin said you wanted to see me?

45:16.930 --> 45:19.210
但愿JB和你一样训练有素
I hope JB's training is going as well as yours is.

45:36.310 --> 45:37.110
艾格西
Eggsy.

45:37.110 --> 45:40.230
我们需要谈话  你可以回去了
I need to have a private conversation. You're dismissed.

45:40.230 --> 45:42.170
说什么呢  让他看着
Nonsense. Let him observe.

45:42.180 --> 45:43.670
说不定能学点东西
Might learn a thing or two.

45:44.270 --> 45:46.530
好吧  来看看这个
As you wish. Take a look at this.

45:46.530 --> 45:48.490
我的老天  我都没使劲儿
Oh, for God's sake, I barely touched you...

45:48.490 --> 45:49.430
你怎么这么...
Oh, man up...

45:49.900 --> 45:51.540
我的老天
Fucking hell!

45:51.850 --> 45:53.560
你也忒暴力了吧  哈利
That is rank, Harry.

45:54.520 --> 45:55.790
居然爆了他的头
You blew up his head?

45:56.070 --> 45:57.630
有点过头了吧
It's a bit much, ain't it?

45:57.630 --> 46:01.530
事实上是他颈部的植入芯片引起了爆炸
Actually the explosion was caused by an implant in his neck.

46:01.530 --> 46:02.960
就在伤疤下面
Here, under the scar.

46:03.560 --> 46:05.880
我的装备有捕捉到触发信号吗
My hardware picked up the signal that triggered it?

46:05.880 --> 46:07.490
好消息是捕捉到了
Fortunately, yes.

46:07.880 --> 46:09.810
但坏消息是追踪到的IP地址
Unfortunately the I.P. Address I traced it to

46:09.810 --> 46:12.180
属于瓦伦丁公司
is registered to the Valentine Corporation.

46:11.740 --> 46:17.250
里士满·瓦伦丁

46:12.180 --> 46:13.330
这可怎么找
Well, that's not much of a lead,

46:13.330 --> 46:15.280
他在全世界可有几百万名员工
he has millions of employees worldwide.

46:15.290 --> 46:17.820
里士满·瓦伦丁就是个天才
That Richmond Valentine is a genius.

Did you not see his annoucement today?

46:24.040 --> 46:24.650

47:20.930 --> 47:23.850
我有必要去会会瓦伦丁先生了
I think Mr. Valentine and I should have a tête-à-tête.

47:27.070 --> 47:29.430
他下周要举办晚宴
He's having a gala dinner next week.

47:29.730 --> 47:31.170
我帮你搞定邀请函
I'll get you an invitation.

47:31.610 --> 47:32.640
不过你千万要小心
You need to be careful, though.

47:32.640 --> 47:34.800
你昏迷后  数百名重要人物都离奇失踪
Since you've been out, hundreds of VIPs have gone missing,

47:34.800 --> 47:37.560
也没有要求支付赎金...跟阿诺德教授一样
no ransom notes...exactly like Professor Arnold.

47:37.560 --> 47:40.740
那就帮我找个值得被绑架的身份吧
And I suggest you make my alias somebody worth kidnapping.

47:55.490 --> 47:56.600
你怎么了  恐高吗
What, you don't like heights?

47:56.600 --> 47:58.040
是啊  不过还好
Yeah, it's okay.

47:58.040 --> 48:01.050
我以前跳过伞  不过应该就是跳过才害怕
I've done it before, which is probably why, come to think of it.

48:02.940 --> 48:04.870
放心吧  你会没事的
Hey, you're gonna be all right.

48:04.870 --> 48:06.260

You're top of the class.

48:08.360 --> 48:09.150
听好了
Listen up.

48:09.150 --> 48:10.860
你们的任务是准确降落在目标地点
You mission is to land on the target

48:10.860 --> 48:12.650
但不能被雷达发现
without the radar detecting you.

48:12.650 --> 48:14.770
一旦被雷达发现或者偏移目标
I read you on the radar or you miss the target,

48:14.770 --> 48:16.010
卷铺盖走人
you go home.

48:16.810 --> 48:18.100
都听懂了吧
Is that understood?

48:21.500 --> 48:23.730
20秒后抵达跳伞区域
Drop zone coming up, 20 seconds.

48:25.420 --> 48:26.360
走吧
We gotta go.

48:36.090 --> 48:38.110
艾格西  我觉得我做不到
Eggsy. I really don't think I can do this.

48:38.110 --> 48:39.180
你当然做不到
Of course you can't.

48:39.180 --> 48:41.060
去后面待着  先看我的吧
Head to the back and I'll show you how, yeah?

48:47.600 --> 48:48.850
来吧

48:49.120 --> 48:51.670
艾格西  艾格西  等等
Eggsy. Eggsy, wait! Hang on!

48:52.210 --> 48:54.430

Follow me, yeah?

49:10.250 --> 49:12.180

哎呦  你们心情都不错嘛
My, my, you're all very cheerful.

50:00.570 --> 50:02.870
真以为这么一帆风顺就过了吗
You really think it was gonna be that straight forward?

50:02.870 --> 50:05.370
送到眼前的情报谁不会看
Any idiot can read a heads-up display,

50:05.370 --> 50:06.780
要想成为王牌特工
but Kingsman agent needs to be able to

50:06.780 --> 50:09.060
得学会在高压环境下解决问题
solve problems under pressure...

50:09.710 --> 50:13.610
比如有人没有降落伞该怎么办
like what to do when one of your group has no parachute.

50:14.550 --> 50:15.350
-什么  -操
- What? - Shit!

50:15.350 --> 50:17.500
谁没降落伞
No parachute? Who?

50:17.860 --> 50:18.750
该死
Fuck!

50:19.020 --> 50:19.880
到底是谁
Which one?

50:19.880 --> 50:21.070
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

50:21.720 --> 50:24.640
再说一次  找准目标  避开雷达
I told you, aim for the target, coming under the radar.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.990
我也不想把谁从地上铲起来
And I hope not to be scraping one of you out.

50:26.990 --> 50:29.710
但如果你真能摔进目标里
But if I do have to and you're inside the target...

50:30.530 --> 50:32.320
至少我会刮目相看的
please know I'll be very impressed.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.300
-该死  -见鬼
- Fuck! - Shit!

50:37.710 --> 50:39.710
大家都听着  我有个计划
Everybody listen, I've got a plan.

50:40.680 --> 50:43.500

Pair up! Grab the closest person to.

50:46.650 --> 50:48.880

见鬼  现在是奇数了
Shit, we're in odd number now!

51:04.710 --> 51:06.030
快  所有人围成一个圈
Quick, make a circle.

51:06.030 --> 51:08.000
说得对  各位  快
Fuck. Right, boys, let's do it.

51:12.700 --> 51:14.860
我们轮流打开降落伞
We pull our chords one by one.

51:14.860 --> 51:16.100
找到那个倒霉蛋后
when we know who's fucked,

51:16.100 --> 51:18.240
右手边的人就抓住他
the person on the right grabs him.

51:19.440 --> 51:20.660

Okay, Eggsy.

51:21.150 --> 51:22.390

51:36.990 --> 51:38.590
地面上见  伙计们
See you on the ground, boys.

51:42.270 --> 51:43.290
该我了
Now me.

51:47.140 --> 51:48.710
该死
Fuck!

51:52.400 --> 51:53.370
罗克茜
Rox,

51:53.370 --> 51:55.880
无论如何我都会保护你  明白吗
no matter what happens now, I've got you, all right?

51:55.790 --> 51:57.340
警告

51:55.790 --> 51:57.340
高度过低

51:59.190 --> 52:00.410
明白  艾格西
Okay, Eggsy.

52:00.410 --> 52:02.250
-你先来行吗  -好
- Yours first, okay? - Yeah.

52:25.450 --> 52:26.740
警告

52:25.450 --> 52:26.740

52:27.000 --> 52:28.350
见鬼
Shit!

52:29.610 --> 52:30.550
罗克茜
Rox!

52:51.590 --> 52:53.990
雨果  迪格比
Hugo. Digby.

52:53.990 --> 52:56.500
进不了目标就做不了特工
You don't land in the K, you're not in the K.

52:56.980 --> 52:59.340
鲁夫斯  降落伞开太早
Rufus, you opened too soon.

52:59.340 --> 53:00.920
怕雷达上看不到你吗
You're all over the radar.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.900

53:07.390 --> 53:08.770
你们刷新了记录
You set a new record.

53:09.240 --> 53:11.810
可不是谁都敢降到300英尺才开降落伞
Opening at 300 feet, that's pretty ballsy.

53:11.810 --> 53:14.680
恭喜你们完成又一项任务  解散
Well done for completing another task. Fall out.

53:15.370 --> 53:16.560
不好意思  先生
Sorry, sir.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.350
你凭什么选我当倒霉蛋
But why the fuck did you choose me as the gim?

53:18.350 --> 53:19.620
你觉得我可以牺牲掉吗
Am I the expendable candidate?

53:19.620 --> 53:21.840
不准你那么跟我说话
No, no, no. You don't talk to me like that.

53:22.550 --> 53:25.610

54:11.840 --> 54:14.590
我专门为您取消了晚宴
I cancelled the gala because of you.

54:14.590 --> 54:18.020
这么大手笔的捐赠  当然得单独宴请
Anybody willing to donate that much deserves their own dinner.

54:18.240 --> 54:19.020

54:20.350 --> 54:21.030

Obviously, I had my people looked into your fair and...

54:32.580 --> 54:34.290
发现您来自一个富贵世家
that's some pretty old money you're from.

54:34.290 --> 54:35.340
你们的钱是怎么赚的啊
How did you folks make it?

54:35.340 --> 54:38.690

您不用担心  没有来路不明的钱
Nothing questionable, if that's your concern.

54:40.420 --> 54:41.370
不是这个意思
Oh, no.

54:41.370 --> 54:43.890
我只是想了解您有多少身家
No. I'm just into finding out what caliber person you are,

54:43.890 --> 54:45.030
您应该能理解的吧
I assume you understand that.

54:45.030 --> 54:46.310

55:14.580 --> 55:15.930

55:18.060 --> 55:20.310

It's goes great with this '45 Lafite.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.390
经典组合
A classic pairing.

55:21.390 --> 55:22.450

您应该知道那方面的研究已经暂缓了吧
You are aware that I wound things down in that area, right?

55:36.580 --> 55:37.780

55:37.780 --> 55:39.270
有权势的人没几个赞同我的
And you're one of the few powerful man

55:39.270 --> 55:40.810
而您是其中之一
who seems to share my concern.

55:40.810 --> 55:43.960
我之所以关停是因为毫无进展
I shut things down because I wasn't getting anywhere.

55:43.960 --> 55:46.940
每一项研究都指向同一个结果
Every bit of research just pointing to the same thing.

55:46.940 --> 55:48.370
碳排放只是个烟雾弹
The carbon emissions are a red herring

55:48.370 --> 55:50.090
恐怕现在无论怎么补救
and we're way past the point of no return

55:50.090 --> 55:52.200
都是无济于事了
no matter what remedial actions we take.

55:52.520 --> 55:54.070

You know, not a lot people knew about him.

56:15.250 --> 56:18.040
您喜欢看间谍片吗  德维尔先生
You like spy movies, Mr. De Vere?

56:21.330 --> 56:24.290
现代的间谍片我觉得太严肃了
Nowadays, they're all a little serious, to my taste.

56:24.670 --> 56:27.280
老片子更精彩
The old ones. Marvelous.

56:27.680 --> 56:30.000
虽然剧情牵强夸张  但我看不厌
Give me a far-fetched theatrical plot any day.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.240

我认为邦德系列里最出彩的还是反派
I always felt the old Bond film were only as good as the villain.

56:43.830 --> 56:44.630
我小时候
As a child, I rather

56:44.630 --> 56:47.450

fancied a future as a colourful meglaomaniac.

56:49.810 --> 56:52.180

56:57.700 --> 56:58.910

给我几天时间来考虑您的提议
Just give me a couple of days to think over your proposal,

57:04.590 --> 57:08.030
然后我派人与您手下联系  就没问题了
I'll have my people get in touch with yours, and it's all good.

57:08.030 --> 57:11.430

Well? Want me to follow him?

57:18.420 --> 57:19.920
用不着

57:19.920 --> 57:22.380
我在酒里下了微型追踪器
I put a nano tracker gel in the wine.

57:22.480 --> 57:25.610
他接下来24小时做了什么我们都会知道
We'll know his every move for the next 24 hours,

57:25.610 --> 57:27.640
总算能知道他是谁的人了
and finally find out who he works for.

57:29.740 --> 57:31.690

正式晋级考核的最后一关
the final stage of the testing process.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.810
依照传统  给你们24小时的时间共处
As traditional goes, you now have 24 hours to spend with them.

01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:10.840
艾格西  要知道你父亲当年也到了这一关
Eggsy, you should know your father reached this point.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:14.940
从现在起  都是真枪实弹了  明白吗
From now on, there are no safety nets, understood?

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:19.650
很好  解散吧
Good, dismissed.

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.480
查理  该回家了
Charlie, time to go home.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.720
去你妈的  看我不叫我爸来整你们
Fuck you, my fucking dad's gonna heard about this.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.980
尿  还是不尿
To pee or not to pee?

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.500
那是我在巴黎
That was the headline the

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.980
成功拆除脏弹当天的报纸头条
day after I defused the dirty bomb in Paris.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:41.100
02世界杯预选赛

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:42.240
-德国1:5英格兰  -错过了那场比赛
- Germany 1, England 5. - Missed that game.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.080
我当时正在五角大楼瓦解卧底间谍组织
I was breaking up an undercover spy ring at the Pentagon.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.010
1981.7.29  查尔斯王子与戴安娜王妃婚礼

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.920
我第一个任务
My first mission.

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.710
挫败了针对玛格丽特·撒切尔的刺杀行动
Foiled the assassination of Margaret Thatcher.

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:56.950
这事可有人不想感谢你
Not everybody had thanked you for that one.

01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:57.920
关键在于  艾格西
The point is, Eggsy,

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.670
根本就没人谢过我
nobody thanked me for any of them.

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:03.780
这些事当天的报纸头条都是些名流的花边新闻
Front page news in all these occasions were celebrity nonsense.

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:05.060
我认为身为王牌特工
I think it's the nature of

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.560
取得了成就也不该为人知
Kingsman that our achievements remain secret.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.370
一位绅士的名字
A gentleman's name should

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:11.530
应该只在报纸上出现三次
appear in the newspaper only three times.

01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:14.180
出生时  结婚时  过世时
When he's born, when he marries, and when he dies.

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:17.880
而身为王牌特工  首先是一位绅士
And we are first and foremost gentlemen.

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:21.290
那我没指望了  就跟查理说的似的
It's me fucked then. It's like Charlie said.

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.930
-我就是个下等人  -胡说
- I'm just a pleb. - Nonsense.

01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:23.680
是不是绅士
Being a gentleman has nothing

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.440
和一个人的出身没有任何关系
to do with the circumstances of one's birth.

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.920
绅士风度是学来的
Being a gentleman is something one learns.

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.500
怎么学
Yeah, but how?

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:33.520
好吧  第一课
All right, first lesson.

01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:35.580
你坐下之前要先征求我的许可
You should've asked me before you took a seat.

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.120
第二课
Second lesson,

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.630
学会调正宗的马提尼
how to make a proper martini.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.460
好的  哈利
Yes, Harry.

01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:49.400
见鬼  疼死个人了
Goddamn it. This fucking hurts.

01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:52.050
是你自己非要装生物特征识别系统的
You are the one who ask for a biometric security system.

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:54.450
-装个按钮不行吗  -按钮
- What's wrong with a simple switch? - A simple switch?

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:58.060
这可是一台极其危险的机器
This is an extremely dangerous machine.

01:04:58.350 --> 01:04:59.520
操作它的人
It should only be operated

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.030
只能是我这样又负责又理智的人
by someone as responsible and sane as me.

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:06.150
如果落进坏蛋手里  那就糟啦
Bad shit could happen if this falls into the wrong hand.

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:12.590
-完事了吗  疼死了  -没  还有这个
- We done here? Shit. - No. Now this one.

01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:14.300
教堂测试的开关
For the test of the church.

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:18.380
这个范围很小  装个按钮就够了
This one does have a short range, a simple switch will do.

01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:26.860
你要不要教我《窈窕淑女》里那种腔调
So you're gonna teach me how to talk proper like My Fair Lady?

01:05:27.050 --> 01:05:28.310
别犯傻
Don't be absurd.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.360
绅士和口音没有关系
Being a gentleman has nothing to do with one's accent,

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.870
关键在于接受现在的自己
it's about being at ease in one's own skin.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.800
正如海明威所说
As Hemmingway said,

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.830
优于别人  并不高贵
there's nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man,

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.590
真正的高贵是优于过去的自己
true nobility is being superior to your former self.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.250
那么  绅士必备品第一件  合体西装
Now, first thing every gentleman needs is a good suit,

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:52.560
我指的是全定制西装  绝不要买成衣
by which I mean a bespoke suit, never off-the-peg.

01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:55.090
王牌特工的西装都是防弹的
And Kingsman's suits are always bulletproof.

01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:57.880
你先去量量尺寸  无论你能不能通过考核
So let's get you measured and whether you get the job or not,

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.650
你都能有一件长久
you'll have a lasting and

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:02.380
且有用的纪念品  纪念在这的时光
useful memento of your time at Kingsman.

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:06.450
实在抱歉  先生  另一位先生正在试衣
I'm so sorry, sir. But a gentleman is completing his fitting.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.830
二号试衣室可用
Fitting Room 2 is available.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:12.840
第一次可不能在二号试衣室凑合
One does not use Fitting Room 2 when one is popping one's cherry.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.230
要不我先带你去三号试衣室看一看
Perhaps I'll show you Fitting Room 3, while we wait.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.340
-这次是向上还是向下  -都不是
- So we're going up or down? - Neither.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:33.080
-就这样吗  -当然不是
- This is it? - Of course not.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.240
拉一下你左边的挂钩
Pull the hook on your left.

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:46.100
棒  真是棒
Oh, yes, very, very nice.

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:51.630
你需要一双好鞋来搭配西装
You're going to need a pair of shoes to go with your suit.

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:55.680
鞋耳根部不缝在鞋面上的系带正装鞋都叫牛津鞋
An Oxford is any formal shoe with open lacing,

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:55.680
此处存疑  牛津鞋的英文维基页面说"closed lacing"
即鞋耳根部与鞋面缝在一起

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.220
这装饰性的花纹就叫雕花
this additional decorative piece is called Brogueing.

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.590
牛津鞋  不雕花
Oxfords, not brogues.

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:03.810
受用一生啊  艾格西  受用一生
Words to live by, Eggsy, words to live by.

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:05.310
穿一双试试
Try a pair.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:08.480
顺便说一句  你武器课程分数蛮高的嘛
Your weapon scores are excellent, by the way.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.190
这些你都见过了
These you're familiar with,

01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:12.160
而这是我们的标准配枪
and this is our standard issue pistol.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.120
可以看出外形不同寻常
It's quite unique as you'll see it,

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.530
在混乱的近战环境下还能发射霰弹
it also fires shot gun cartridge for use in messy close range situations.

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:19.000
-感觉怎样  -挺好的
- How do they feel? - Yeah, good.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.290
现在你尽力模仿一下
Now do your very best impersonation

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.790
德国贵族式的正礼
of a German aristocrat's formal greeting.

01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:27.160
错  艾格西
No, Eggsy.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.350
太牛逼了
That is sick.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.590
过去鞋跟里还装着移动电话
In the old days they had a phone in the heels as well.

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:36.620
该怎么缩回去
How do I get it back in?

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.400
刀刃上涂了一层
Well it's coated with one of

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.450
发作速度最快的神经毒素  所以...
the fastest acting neurotoxins known to man, so...

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:42.130
千万小心
very carefully.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.000
这东西我玩过许多次了
Now, I've had a lot of fun with this.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.790
是我们顶尖化工技术的结晶
One of our finest examples of chemical engineering.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.680
这种毒药服下后是无害的
A poison, harmless when ingested,

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:58.810
但你完全可以视情形需要远程激活
but at a time convenient to you, can be remotely activated.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.610
随时可以致命
Primed, lethal.

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:06.050
那这些呢  是做什么用的
What about these? What do these do?

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:09.260
-电击器吗  -别逗了  那是手榴弹
- Electrocute you? - Don't be ridiculous. That's a hand grenade.

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.020
不是吧
Shut up.

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.360
想电人的话  要用印章戒指
You want to electrocute someone, you'll need a signet ring.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.710
传统上  绅士把印章戒指戴在左手
A gentleman traditionally wears the signet ring on his left hand,

01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:15.570
但王牌特工
but a Kingsman wears it

01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:17.820
都戴在惯用手上
on which ever hand happens to be dominant.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:21.090
按下戒指上的触点  就会发出五万伏电压
Touch the contact behind the ring, it delivers 50,000 Volts.

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:26.020
-那些呢  有什么特殊的地方  -没什么
- And what about them? What makes them so special? - Nothing.

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.400
是大众科技终于追上了间谍科技的步伐
That technology's caught up with the spy world.

01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:31.760
放回去  艾格西
Put it back, Eggsy.

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:37.500
正好  那位先生试衣结束了
Ah, perfect timing. The gentleman's just finished.

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:48.040
德维尔先生  好巧啊
Mr. De Vere, what a coincidence.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:51.250
我就是因为你来的
You are totally the reason I'm here.

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:52.250
你从我家走了之后
When you left my house,

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:56.310
我就特想弄件你那样帅爆了的晚礼服
I was thirsting for that dope ass smoking jacket you had on.

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:58.200
我要去皇家爱斯科赛马会
And since I'm going to Royal Ascot,

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.650
必须得穿这种正装吧
apparently you need one of these penguin suits.

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:03.710
所以我就来了  你来干什么了
Here I am. What are you doing here?

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.380
你好啊哥们  我是里士满·瓦伦丁
What's up man? Richmond Valentine.

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:09.570
这是我新招的随扈  我带他来见我的裁缝
This is my new valet, I was just introducing him to my tailor.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:12.210
太巧了  我也是
Another coincidence. So am I.

01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:15.280
您又考虑我的提议了吗
Have you had any chance to think further on my proposal?

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.580
当然了
Most definitely.

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:17.470
我的人
My people will be getting

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:20.880
很快会和你联系的  我保证
in touch with you very soon. I guarantee it.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:25.600
提个建议  去皇家赛马会还需要戴大礼帽
A word of advise. Ascot requires top hat.

01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:30.340
我建议您去洛扣公司  定制礼帽
I might suggest Lock and Co., hatters.

01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.430
-圣詹姆斯街上  -烤鱼的烤
- St. James'. - Lox as in smoked fish?

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:35.330
锁扣的扣
As in 'locked up'.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.730
有时候真是听不懂你们说的话
I have trouble understanding you people some times.

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.790
你们都  不好好说话
Y'all...talk so funny.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.500
先生们  他就麻烦你们了
Gentlemen, would you look after him, please.

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:10.430
这才是爆有型的礼帽
Now, this is a dope ass top hat.

01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:15.220
瞪羚  咱们看赛马去
Gazelle, let's go Ascotting.

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:18.490
怎么回事  瞪羚
What happened there, Gazelle?

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:20.900
快点  我要让女王等我了
Come on, don't make me late for the queen.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.600
快走  瞪羚  要迟到了
Come on, Gazelle. We gonna be late.

01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:27.850
赛马场多远  多远来着
How far is Ascot? How far?

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.970
-梅林说您想见我  长官  -请坐
- Merlin said you wanted to see me, sir? - Sit down.

01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:44.670
-小狗挺不错  叫什么  -JB
- Pretty dog. What's his name? - JB.

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:47.230
-詹姆斯·邦德的缩写  -不是
- As in James Bond? - No.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.480
-杰森·伯恩  -不  是杰克·鲍尔- Jason Bourne? - No, Jack Bauer.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.480
美剧《24小时》男主

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.270
选得好
Bravo.

01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:56.340
虽然我不想承认  艾格西
It pains me to admitt it, Eggsy,

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.470
但我你也许有一天
but I think that one day

01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:00.070
也能成为和他们一样优秀的特工
you might be as good a spy as any of them.

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:08.830
拿着
Take it.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.480
把狗打死
Shoot the dog.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:29.970
枪上膛了  把狗打死
This weapon is live. Shoot the dog.

01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:09.510
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:22.510
还是姑娘有胆子
At lease the girl's got balls.

01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:27.170
出去
Get out.

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:29.540
我就知道你不行
I knew you couldn't make it.

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.050
回家吧
Go home.

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:38.470
梅林  请让罗克茜进来吧
Merlin, send in Roxy, please.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.030
欢迎加入王牌特工
Welcome, to Kingsman.

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:07.660
兰斯洛特
Lancelot.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.290
-妈  -艾格西
- Mom. - Eggsy.

01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:36.890
天啊你去哪了  我担心死你了
God, where you've been? I've been so worried about you.

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:41.620
天啊  你都长这么大了
Oh my days, just look how big you grow.

01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:50.680
-他在哪  -我没事  艾格西
- Where is he? - I'm fine. Eggsy.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.820
求你了  求你别去惹他
Please, please, just don't get involved.

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.730
不  我就不该留下你一个人
No, I should've never have left you on your own.

01:13:54.010 --> 01:13:55.950
这事到此为止了
This stops right now.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:58.650
-马上回来  -艾格西
- Be right back. - Eggsy.

01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:06.100
-迪恩  -小废物  你回来了
- Dean. - Oh, Mugsy, so you're back.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.100
怎么  现在改偷出租车了
What, you nicked a fucking taxi now?

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.160
没错  我要跟你谈谈我妈眼上的伤
Yeah. Can I have a word about my mom's black eye.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:14.620
你还想跟我谈  你一下那出租车
You wanna have a word with me, you get out that cab,

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:16.970
我立马打得你找不着北
I'll knock you staight back down your fucking ass.

01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:21.120
先让你的狗腿子进去  然后我再出来
Tell your muppets to go inside, then I'll get out.

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:24.860
去吧  小子们  两下就搞定了
Go on, lads. There'll be two hits.

01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:27.060
一下揍他  一下他倒地
Me hittin' him. And him hittin' the floor.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.490
来吧  小兔崽子
Come on, then, you prick.

01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:32.070
看看你有什么本事  想打我
Let's see what you got, eh? Want a bit of me?

01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:35.190
-你干什么  -不  不  别这样
- What you're doing? - No, no, no. Come on.

01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:36.300
你干什么  你要去哪儿
What you're doing? Where you going?

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.670
你这个蠢货  就这么没种
You mug. What, you ain't got no bollocks?

01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:41.140
那家伙打了我妈妈
Come on, he hit my fucking mum!

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:43.790
等你带种了再来找我吧  蠢货
Come back when you've grown a pair. Muggsy.

01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:11.640
你为了一只狗放弃了自己的大好前程
You throw away your biggest opportunity over a fucking dog.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.400
然后你还偷了我老板的车给我蒙羞
And then you humiliate me by stealing my boss's car.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.380
你为了一份破工作就冲自己的狗开枪
You shot a dog just to get a fucking job.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.650
没错
Yes, I did.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.830
每次我上厕所看到泡菜  就想起当时的场景
And Mr. Pickle here reminds me of that every time I take a shit.

01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:29.640
你打死自己的狗还把它做成了标本吗
You shot your dog and had it stuffed?

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.450
你个变态
You fucking freak.

01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:32.750
不  我对我的狗开枪了
No, I shot my dog,

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.670
之后我把它带回家里
and then I brought him home and

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:35.680
又继续养了它11年
continue to care for him for the next 11 years,

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.850
直到它死于胰腺炎
until he died of pancreatitis.

01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:40.670
-什么  -那是空弹  艾格西
- What? - It was a blank, Eggsy.

01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:43.270
只是发空弹
It was a fucking blank.

01:15:44.130 --> 01:15:46.480
-你还记得阿米莉亚吗  -记得
- Remember Amelia? - Yeah.

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.850
她并没有淹死
She didn't drown.

01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:49.780
她是我们柏林技术部门的人
She works in our tech department in Berlin.

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:50.740
还活得好好的
She's fine.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:52.160
必须要测试你的极限
Limits must be tested,

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.010
除非需要你救人一命  否则不能牺牲他人
Kingsman only condone the risking of a life to save another.

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:57.780
比如你疏忽了  我爸却牺牲生命救你吗
Like my dad saved your life, even though your fuck-up cost his?

01:15:58.140 --> 01:15:59.950
你怎么不把他也做成标本放在这儿
What, you got him stuffed here and all?

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:02.720
你看不出来我做的一切
Can't you see that everything

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:05.160
都是为了报答他的救命之恩吗
I've done has been about trying to repay him?

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.270
哈利  你听这个
Harry, listen to this.

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:14.380
瓦伦丁终于说了点有用的了
Valetine's at last saying something of note.

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:17.120
你们知道我为什么喜欢笔和纸吗
You know what I love about pen and paper?

01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:19.830
因为没人能入侵
Nobody can hack into this shit.

01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:23.800
我们的环球之旅是一个巨大的成功
Our world wide tour was a complete success.

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:26.600
该到手的都到手了
We have total coverage.

哈利王子

01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:29.560
就像玩宾戈的时候  把数字全划掉一样
Like when all your numbers in bingo are crossed out.

01:16:29.690 --> 01:16:30.530
宾戈
Bingo?

01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:34.610
宾戈  那个数字游戏  你应该玩过吧
Bingo, the game, you have played bingo, right?

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.490
我可能玩那个吗
Do I look like I play bingo?

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:40.180
关键是
The point is,

01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:42.920
如果明天教堂的实验顺利的话
if our test go well at the church tomorrow,

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.860
我们就可以行动了
we are good to go.

01:16:45.090 --> 01:16:47.210
南部林间教堂
South Glade Mission Church.

01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:50.840
-梅林  准备好飞机  -好
- Merlin get the plane ready. - Will do.

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:53.420
-哈利  对不起  我  -你确实该道歉
- Harry, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna do... - You should be.

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:54.710
你老实待在这儿
You just stay right there,

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.520
等我解决了问题再收拾你
I'll sort this mess up when I get back.

01:16:58.590 --> 01:17:03.800
肯塔基 美国

01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:05.710
我告诉你们  看看这世界吧
And I say to you, bear witness.

01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:09.770
看看新闻  艾滋病
Watch the news. Watch the news. AIDS,

01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:13.740
洪水  无辜之人泼洒鲜血
floods, the blood of the innocent spilled.

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:19.100
还有人怀疑这不是上帝在降怒吗
And yet, there are those who doubt this is the wrath of God.

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:27.550
我们堕落的政府纵容鸡奸  离婚  堕胎
Our filthy government condones sodomy, divorce, abortion,

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:33.850
还有人在怀疑  这不是伪基督干的吗
and yet some still doubt, this is work of the Antichrist.

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:36.040
哪怕你不是犹太人
You do not have to be a Jew,

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.220
黑人  妓女
a nigga, a whore, or an

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:42.420
或是信仰科学的进化论支持者...
atheistic science-loving evolution spouter...

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.820
说得真好
Charming sermon.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.890
你能看到瓦伦丁吗
Can you see Valetine anywhere?

01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:50.980
朋友们  虽然他是公正的上帝  却也会...
So my friends, although he is a just God, he is a vengeful one...

01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:57.310
你能肯定我们在范围外吗
You're sure we're out of range?

01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:58.990
离那一千多英尺呢  怎么了
We're over thousand feet away, what's wrong?

01:17:58.990 --> 01:18:00.550
要是计算有误怎么办
What if the calculations are wrong?

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:02.050
你只要相信我就好了
You just have to trust me.

01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:05.990
犹太人  黑人  还有同性恋
Jew, niggar, fag lovers

01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:09.960
撒旦会让他们永世受烈焰煎熬
and the devil is burning them for all eternity.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.590
-请让一下  -你要去哪儿
- Excuse me. - Where're you going?

01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:15.420
你搞什么
What's your problem?

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.300
我是一个信奉天主教的男妓
I'm a Catholic whore currently enjoying a congress out of wedlock

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:21.990
还和一个犹太裔的黑人搞婚外情
with my black jewish boyfriend

01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:24.270
他在一家军方的流产门诊部工作
who works at a military abortion clinic.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.600
撒旦万岁
So hail Satan.

01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:28.510
祝您有一个愉快的下午  夫人
And have a lovely afternoon, madam.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.260
天哪  他要走了  我得马上开始实验
Oh, shit, he's leaving, I'm starting the test now.

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.000
但愿这群蠢货没少领SIM卡
Hope enough of these freaks have our SIM cards.

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:47.520
你个异教徒要是就这么走了
You just leave this church like the infidel you are.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:53.010
你会吞食你的后代
You will eat your babies...

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:59.380
主的血液会淹没你的  主不会拯救你
You will drown in the blood of the Lord. He will not save you.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.970
我操
Oh fuck.

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:09.260
天哪  我不能看这个  到这儿来
Oh shit, I can't watch this. Get over here.

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.180
天哪  不是吧
Jesus, fuck.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.050
加拉哈德  你能听到我说话吗
Galahad, can you hear me?

01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:57.790
哈利
Harry.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.110
哈利  这是怎么回事
Harry, what the heck is going on?

01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:03.470
你能把声音关小点吗
Can you just turn the volume down, please?

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.330
没想到效果这么好
I didn't expect it to be that effective.

01:20:06.330 --> 01:20:08.090
这效果有多好
What kind of response are we talking?

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.020
100%
One hundred percent.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.150
不管领没领手机卡  所有人都被影响了吗
So everyone's been effected, whether they have a sim card or not?

01:20:14.150 --> 01:20:16.780
还能顺便消灭个王牌特工
And we get to add the benefit of wiping out the Kingsman.

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.120
还没死呢
Not yet.

01:21:13.690 --> 01:21:15.310
你该看看这个
Oh, you need to see this.

01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:15.650
你对我做了什么  我控制不了自己
What did you do to me? I had no control.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.410
我把那些人全杀了
I killed all those people.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.050
-而且是自愿的  -很聪明  是不是
- I wanted to. - Clever, isn't it?

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:26.100
简单来说  就是发射神经电信号
In simple terms, it's a neurological wave,

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:27.820
会大大激发人的侵略性
that triggers the center of aggression,

01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.510
并且关闭人体的抑制机能
and switches off the inhibiters.

01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:33.130
通过你那免费SIM卡传播的吧
Transmitted through your nasty free sim cards I assume?

01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:37.790
你知道这像什么吗
You know what this looks like?

01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:41.670
就像我们都爱看的老电影
This like those old movies we both love.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.020
现在我应该把自己的计划都告诉你
Now I'm gonna tell you my whole plan

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.080
然后想出一种
and then I'm gonna come up

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.050
复杂又古怪的方法杀你
with some absurd and convoluted way to kill you

01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:51.270
可你会想出一个同样绝妙的方式逃脱
and you'll find an equally convoluted way to escape.

01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:53.400
我觉得可以这样
Sounds good to me.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.200
可这不是那种电影
Well, this ain't that kind of movie.

01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:02.620
不
No!

01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:11.900
他死了吗
Is he dead?

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.090
冲人脑袋开一枪  一般都会死的
That tends to happen when you shoot someone in the head.

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:17.980
-感觉不错吧  -不  一点都不好
- It feels good, right? - No, it does not feel good.

01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.040
感觉糟透了
It feels fucking awful.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.630
什么  教堂里多少人都是你杀的
What? You just killed how many people in that church?

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.640
-这才一个  -不  那些人是自相残杀
- This is one guy. - No, no, no, they killed each other.

01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:31.010
好了  设好倒计时  我们的派对
Okay, send down the countdown clock. This party starts...

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.330
明天开始
tomorrow.

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:08.210
亚瑟
Arthur.

01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:13.960
-你在吗  -很不幸  我在
- Are you there? - Sadly, I am.

01:25:14.890 --> 01:25:17.170
召集所有王牌特工
Assemble the Kingsmen.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:23.240
你难道看不出来我做的一切
Can't you see that everything

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.630
都是为了报答他的救命之恩吗
I've done has been about trying to repay him?

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.890
是个充满潜力的小伙子
I see a young man with potential,

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:51.900
这辈子想做点好事
who wants to do something good in his life.

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.260
亚瑟  哈利死了
Arthur, Harry's dead.

01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:17.760
加拉哈德死了  我们刚敬了他一杯
Galahad is dead. Hence, we have just drunk a toast to him.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.990
那你也知道那个疯子要做什么吧
Well, then you know what that psycho's doing.

01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:23.190
全世界有多少人领了他的手机卡
How many people around the world have got those SIM cards?

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.980
瓦伦丁可以把信号发给他们任何一个人
Valentine can send his signal to any of them, all of them,

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:28.050
一旦他们都开始自相残杀
if they all go homicidal at the same time, then...

01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:30.550
是啊  多亏了加拉哈德的录像
Indeed, and thanks to Galahad's recordings,

01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:32.600
我们拿到了瓦伦丁的供词
we have Valentine's confession.

01:26:33.330 --> 01:26:36.910
情报已经递交给了有关部门
The intellegence have been passed on to the relevant authorities,

01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:38.410
我们的任务完成了
our work is complete.

01:26:38.410 --> 01:26:42.470
这也是我们死去的战友留下的珍贵遗产
And a most distinguished legacy for our fallen friend it is too.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.880
就这样吗
And that's it?

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.430
来  坐下  孩子
Come and sit down, boy.

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:55.870
这是1815年的拿破仑白兰地
This, is an 1815 Napoleonic Brandy.

01:26:56.710 --> 01:27:00.650
只有王牌特工中有人牺牲时  我们才会饮用
And we only drink it when we lose a Kingsman.

01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:02.870
加拉哈德很欣赏你
Galahad was very fond of you.

01:27:05.710 --> 01:27:09.580
这一次  我觉得我们可以适当地
And on this occasion, I think it's acceptable for us,

01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:12.260
破一下例
to bend the rules a little.

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.400
那些都是王牌特工吗
These are all Kingsmen?

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:17.400
是的  他们是创始人
Yes, they're founder members.

01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:21.470
咱们两个敬杯酒
I want you to join me in a toast.

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.860
敬加拉哈德
To Galahad.

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:27.590
敬加拉哈德
To Galahad.

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.680
哈利说你不喜欢破例  亚瑟
Harry said you don't like to break rules, Arthur.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.640
现在为什么破例
Why now?

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.360
你表现很好  艾格西
You're very good, Eggsy.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:41.710
也许我会提议由你来接替加拉哈德的职位
Perhaps I will make you my proposal for Galahad's position.

01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:43.850
当然了  前提是你和我
Provided of course, if we can

01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:47.790
能在一些政治问题上达成共识
see eye to eye on certain political matters.

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.310
你来猜一猜  这是什么
Can you guess, what this is?

01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:56.970
我不用猜  哈利告诉过我了
I don't have to, Harry showed me.

01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:58.570
你一按  我就死
You click it, I die.

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.910
我就觉得那白兰地味道有点怪
I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.880
-很好  -瓦伦丁收买了你
- Bravo. - Valentine won you over, somehow.

01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:09.870
他一解释  我就明白了
Once he explained, I understood.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.910
你感染上病毒  就会发烧
When you get a virus, you get a fever,

01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:14.250
这是人体通过升温
that's the human body raising

01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:16.810
来杀灭病毒
it's core temperature to kill the virus.

01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:19.330
地球也是一样
Planet Earth works the same way.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:24.190
全球变暖是地球在发烧  而人类正是病毒
Global warming is the fever. Mankind is the virus.

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:27.050
我们让地球病了
We're making our planet sick.

01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:29.380
只能寄希望于大清洗
A cull is our only hope.

01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:32.300
如果不主动减少人口
If we don't reduce our population ourselves,

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:34.760
最终只有那么两种结局
there's only one or two ways this gonna go.

01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:39.100
宿主杀死病毒  或是病毒杀死宿主
The host kills the virus, or the virus kills the host.

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.460
-不管哪一种  -结果都是一样的
- Either way... - The result is the same.

01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:44.890
病毒会被消灭
The virus dies.

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.240
因此瓦伦丁决定亲自解决人口问题
So Valentine's gonna take care the population problem himself.

01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:52.140
就算我们不行动  大自然也会行动
But if we don't do something, nature will.

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.230
有时候  必须清洗掉低等人类
Sometimes the culling is the

01:28:53.230 --> 01:28:56.280
才能保证种族的繁衍
only way to ensure that the species survives.

01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:59.360
历史将会见证
And history will see Valentine

01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:02.380
瓦伦丁拯救人类于灭顶之灾
as a man who saved humanity from extinction.

01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:05.490
所以他来决定清洗谁  是吗
And he gets to pick and choose who gets culled, does he?

01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:07.270
他有钱的朋友都会活下来
All his rich mates they get to live,

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.510
他认为有价值活下去的人
and anyone he thinks is worth saving

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:11.590
无论他们是否赞成  他都会保护他们
he's keeping them safe. Whether they agree with him or not.

01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:16.070
至于你  艾格西  看哈利的面子
And you, Eggsy, in Harry's honor,

01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:20.910
我邀请你成为新世界的一员
I am inviting you to be part of a new world.

01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:26.210
该做决定了
It's time to make your decision.

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:36.390
我还是见哈利去吧  谢谢
I'd rathe be with Harry. Thanks.

01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:38.270
请便吧
So be it.

01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:59.630
我们这些平民  就是喜欢乱动东西
The problem with us common types is, that we're light fingered.

01:30:01.050 --> 01:30:04.300
王牌特工教会了我很多东西  可这种花招
Kingsmans taught me a lot, but... sleight of hand...

01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:06.630
是的  他们是创始人
Yes, they're founder members.

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.750
我早就学会了
I had that down already.

01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:17.700
你这个小王八蛋
You dirty, little fucking prick.

01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:46.790
V日倒计时
速至安全区
或飞至
北纬66°58'30"
东经61°43'4"

01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:54.410
好了  兰斯洛特  把枪放下
It's okay, Lancelot, put it down.

01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:56.380
已经证实了
It's verified.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.770
亚瑟手机收到的信息说找安全的地方
Arthur's phone's recieving update text about getting to safety.

01:31:01.770 --> 01:31:03.750
-我们的时间不多了  -你打算怎么办
- We don't have a lot of time. - What you're going to do?

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:05.320
应该是我们打算怎么办
Question's what we gonna do?

01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:08.590
谁知道还有谁被瓦伦丁收买了
God knows who's in Valentine's pocket and who's not.

01:31:09.490 --> 01:31:10.740
我们没有办法
We've no choice.

01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:14.260
只能靠我们自己了
We're going to have to deal with it ourselves.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:18.500
跟我来
Follow me.

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.900
-这是什么玩意  -我不知道
- What the fuck is this? - I've no idea.

01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:43.460
你手里的这个家伙
What you're playing with,

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:46.210
是单人跨大气层飞行舱的样机
is a prototype personal transatmosphere vehicle.

01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:48.700
这是在里根的星球大战计划中发明的
It was developed as part of Reagan's "Star Wars" project.

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:51.620
设计很基础  但应该好用
It's pretty basic, but should still work.

01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:54.310
我们要炸掉瓦伦丁的一个卫星
We're gonna take out one of Valentine's satellites.

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:57.210
切断传播链  阻止信号传播
We're gonna break the chain, stop the signal.

01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.680
他要花上好几个小时才能安排好新的线路
It'll take him couple of hours to reroute it,

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.410
刚好能争取到足够的时间
which buys us enough time

01:32:01.410 --> 01:32:03.520
让你帮我黑进瓦伦丁的主机
for you to get me into Valentine's mainframe

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:04.950
然后关掉它
so I can shut it down.

01:32:06.150 --> 01:32:09.560
兰斯洛特  你要驾驶它  穿上宇航服
Lancelot, you're gonna be using it. Get into your halo suit.

01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:24.830

01:32:42.230 --> 01:32:44.790
来的都是超级紧张的人
I figure we're just getting the really nervous ones.

植入的芯片会发射抗干扰信号

免受手机卡电磁波的干扰
unaffected by the waves on the SIM cards.

01:32:56.010 --> 01:32:58.220
让所有人变成杀人狂魔的电磁波吗
The waves that turned everyone into a psycho killer?

01:32:58.230 --> 01:32:59.220
没错
Quite.

01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.820
可是他没有告诉那些人
But what he probably didn't tell anyone,

01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:02.150
这种芯片可以按照指令
is it can also super heat

01:33:02.150 --> 01:33:04.250
让他们软组织过热

01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:08.920
瓦伦丁留下的人都是精心挑选的
Valentine selected his chosen few to get the countdown warning.

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:10.610
他必须要确保

你上升的高度越高  气球就会膨胀得越大
The higher you go, the more the balloons expand.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:38.260
你一到达大气层边缘  气球就会爆炸
When you reach the edge of the atmosphere, it will explode.

01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:41.280
必须在那之前部署好导弹  明白吗
You need to deploy the missile just before that, okay?

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.920
-大气层边缘  -你一部署好
- The edge of the atmosphere. - Once you deployed,

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:46.090
就要马上脱离  以迅速下降

-这些家伙怎么了  -我不知道
- What the fuck's wrong with them? - I don't know.

01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:44.670
可能是因为要发生大屠杀吧
Could have something to do with the mass genocide?

01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:45.880
把话筒给我
Give me the mic.

01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:52.990

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:42.910

01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:01.150
你真懂我
You're in my mind!

01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:03.750
你要多久能搞定
How long before you make that happen?

01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:07.680

你得抓紧了
Get a move on!

01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.730

Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?

01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:27.480
还没有  不过快了
Not yet, but he will be soon.

01:47:27.490 --> 01:47:28.440

They're coming at me from both sides.

01:47:58.380 --> 01:47:59.810

告诉她  我爱她
And tell her I love her.

01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:20.790
我操
Oh, for fuck's sake!

01:48:24.990 --> 01:48:28.530
梅林  还记得你说没用的芯片吗
Merlin, remember those implants you said were of no use to us?

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:31.570
你有办法激活吗
Any chance you can turn them on?

01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:38.570
对啊  轮到我玩你了  瓦伦丁
Right. My turn to play, Valentine.

01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:49.700
不不不  他在做什么
No. No, no! What the fuck is he...

01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.010
我没法阻止他
I can't stop this!

Merlin you're a fucking genius!

01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.480
外面发生了什么事
What the fuck is happening out there?

01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:22.870
你不是那个失踪的公主吗
Aren't you that princess who went missing?

01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:24.070
你能救我出去吗
Can you get me out?

01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:26.260
我救你的话  你能吻我一下吗
Well, if I do, will you give me a kiss?

01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:28.110
我一直想吻公主
I've always wanted to kiss a princess.

01:50:28.110 --> 01:50:30.660
你现在救我出去  可不只给你个吻
If you get me out right now, I'll give you more than just a kiss.

01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:33.890
你个混蛋
You motherfucker!

01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:35.370
你真的以为我会蠢到
Did you really think I was stupid enough

01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:38.310
给自己也植入那玩意儿吗
to implant one of those things in my own head?

01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:40.380
你他妈是疯了吗
What are you, fucking crazy?

01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:43.760
害死这么多无辜的人为了什么
All those innocent people killed, and for what?

01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:47.240
你根本阻止不了我
You didn't stop shit!

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:50.430
好了  我把门锁好了  你还想要我做什么
Fine, I've locked the door. What do you want me to do now?

As I said, put your daughter

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.930
锁进浴室里  再把钥匙扔了

Are you fucking insane?

01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:59.350
照做就行了
Just do it.

01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:27.930

还是你穿得人模狗样
Or are you gonna run away again

02:00:40.450 --> 02:00:42.670
是为了拿去法院当借口跑路啊
