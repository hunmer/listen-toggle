老大

01:08.680 --> 01:10.410
-鲍比  -老大
- Bobby. - Boss?

01:11.640 --> 01:13.670
给我来一品脱啤酒和一个酱蛋
I'll have a pint and a pickled egg.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.250
马上就来
Coming straight up.

Cumberland Gap - David Rawlings

01:46.420 --> 01:48.990
如果想成为丛林之王
If you wish to be the king of the jungle,

01:49.340 --> 01:51.750
仅在举手投足间远远不够
it's not enough to act like a king.

01:54.430 --> 01:56.080
必须成为王者
You must be the king.

01:57.230 --> 01:58.840
不能有疑虑
And there can be no doubt.

02:00.060 --> 02:04.260
因为疑虑会导致混乱和自身的死亡
Because doubt causes chaos and one's own demise.

Hello, my love.

02:17.410 --> 02:18.730
今晚是约会之夜
It's date night tonight.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.280
九点  我们俩  河滨餐厅
Nine o'clock, you and I, River Cafe.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.160
谁在说话
Who's there?

02:28.380 --> 02:29.740
罗莎  是谁
Ros, who's there?

03:19.600 --> 03:26.200
绅士们

04:59.200 --> 05:00.310
叮  叮
Chink, chink.

05:07.290 --> 05:08.400
弗莱彻
Fletcher.

05:08.790 --> 05:11.450
下午好  雷蒙德
Buenas tardes, Raymondo.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.670
我真该用那根擀面杖捅死你
I should stab you with that fucking rolling pin.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.180
别这么大怨气
Oh, don't be cunty.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.870
我还想我俩能一起舒舒服服地小酌一杯
I was just hoping we could have a cozy little drink together.

05:20.310 --> 05:24.830
我周六要去你最喜欢的报社那边开会
So, I've got a meeting on Saturday at your favorite newspaper.

05:25.890 --> 05:30.460
以这个乌烟瘴气的小镇上最厉害的私家侦探的身份
As the best private investigator in this smoky little town...

05:30.570 --> 05:32.230
晚上好  女士们先生们
good evening, ladies and gentlemen...

05:32.230 --> 05:35.430
他们打算给我十五万
they are ready to put 150 grand in my pocket

05:35.430 --> 05:36.850
让我给他们一点黑料
to give them some filth.

05:36.860 --> 05:39.720
对我来说是件好事  但这次...
Good for me, that, but in this case...

05:41.080 --> 05:42.350
对你就不太有利了
it's bad for you.

05:43.750 --> 05:47.440
顶尖编辑大戴夫
So Big Dave, editor extraordinaire,

05:47.500 --> 05:51.590
对你的老板以及他那帮
has developed a terrible antipathy for your boss

05:51.590 --> 05:54.460
无恶不作的狐朋狗友们颇有怨言
and his liquorish assortment of tasty mates.

05:54.460 --> 05:56.200
他打算出手毁了他
He's out to destroy him

05:56.510 --> 05:58.030
还有所有跪舔他的人
and all those that cozy up to him.

05:58.030 --> 05:59.550
头版头条  砰
Front cover. Bosh!

05:59.550 --> 06:02.160
到时候会鸡飞狗跳血流满地的  亲爱的
There will be blood and fucking feathers everywhere, my darling.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.350
继续说  弗莱彻  我开始好奇了
Get to it, Fletcher. I'm starting to itch.

06:05.350 --> 06:08.520
我们都知道  你老板的荷包非常非常鼓
Now, we both know that your boss has very, very deep pockets,

06:08.520 --> 06:11.590
所以我希望他能稍稍掏一点出来
and I would like to invite him just to have a teeny rummage in them.

06:13.150 --> 06:14.900
你他妈在说什么呢
What the fuck are you talking about?

06:14.900 --> 06:16.150
如果能劳烦你
If you would be so kind as

06:16.150 --> 06:18.150
给我两千万英镑
to furnish me with 20 million British pounds,

06:18.150 --> 06:19.860
我就把所有东西都给你...
I will give you everything...

06:19.860 --> 06:23.280
存储卡  联系人列表  录音  所有一切
memory cards, contact sheets, recordings, the lot,

06:23.280 --> 06:26.790
附赠不才创作的小剧本一篇
and a modest little screenplay I wrote all by myself.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.720
《叶子》
剧本草稿
弗莱彻作

06:26.790 --> 06:27.690
等等
Hold on.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.320
十五万怎么就变成了两千万
We just went from ￡150,000 to 20 million.

06:32.420 --> 06:34.460
这才过了短短三十秒
That's a steep rise in 30 seconds.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.090
是  但我觉得是你赚到了
Yeah, but I would argue that you're lucky ,

06:36.090 --> 06:38.770
这点钱不算什么  我本可以狮子大开口的
because that is nothing compared to what I could,

06:38.770 --> 06:41.180
或许我该开口
and perhaps should, be asking.

06:41.180 --> 06:44.430
谢天谢地你并不贪心  弗莱彻
Oh, well, thank God you're not greedy, Fletcher,

06:44.430 --> 06:47.040
你个失心疯的吃屎王八蛋
you deluded, shit-eating cunt.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.800
我挺喜欢你对我骂脏话的
I quite like it when you talk dirty to me.

06:51.940 --> 06:54.470
听得我都硬了
I can feel myself engorging.

06:54.980 --> 06:57.590
来嘛  陪我喝一杯  真的很好喝
Come on, have a drink with me. It's really yummy.

06:57.820 --> 07:01.010
我用手机应用查了下  一千五百镑
I looked it up. App-ed it. 1500 quid?

07:01.280 --> 07:04.060
不知道你还舍得买这么贵的英格兰威士忌
I didn't know you could spend that much on a bottle of scotch.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.280
我要给你讲个故事
I'm gonna tell you a story

07:06.290 --> 07:09.480
证明我的报价很公道
to demonstrate why my quote is my quote.

07:10.620 --> 07:12.360
你能陪我玩个游戏吗  雷
Will you play a game with me, Ray?

07:13.540 --> 07:15.030
我不想玩游戏
I don't wanna play a game.

07:15.750 --> 07:18.700
-求你了  -不要
- Please? - No.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.120
快过来陪我玩游戏  雷
I said play a fucking game with me, Ray.

07:29.810 --> 07:30.840
好吧
Right.

07:31.310 --> 07:32.170
棒极了
Lovely.

07:32.850 --> 07:36.300
现在  请你想象一个角色
Now, I want you to imagine a character,

07:36.440 --> 07:37.580
一个戏中的角色
a dramatic character,

07:37.580 --> 07:39.950
像是书中  戏剧或是电影里的角色
like in a book or a play or a film.

07:39.950 --> 07:42.450
但不要存在U盘上的数字版
But not digital, not on a memory stick.

07:42.450 --> 07:44.470
要模拟信号  化学处理的电影胶片
Analog. Chemical process.

07:42.450 --> 07:44.470
旧式电影电视使用模拟信号  如今使用数字信号

07:44.470 --> 07:46.240
我觉得"要留住影像的颗粒感"
"Keep the grain in the picture," I say.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.190
老派的  三十五毫米胶片
Old-school, 35 mill.

07:52.870 --> 07:54.420
现在我是透过镜头看着这一幕  真的
Now, I'm seeing this through a lens, I am,

07:54.420 --> 07:56.380
而且我说的不是小屏幕
and I'm not talking about the small screen.

07:56.380 --> 07:58.250
这不是电视剧  雷蒙德
It's not TV, Raymond.

07:58.250 --> 08:01.210
就像我刚刚说的  是老电影的形式
As I said, old-school cinema format.

08:01.220 --> 08:02.920
我们业内人士称之为变形宽银幕
It's what we in the business called anamorphic,

08:01.220 --> 08:04.970
传统胶片电影通过使用变形镜头
将2.35:1的宽银幕影像"压缩至"35毫米的胶片之中

08:02.930 --> 08:04.970
屏幕比例2.35:1
or ratio 2.35 to 1.

08:04.970 --> 08:08.060
希望你能加入我  一起踏上这段电影旅程
And I want you to join me on this cinematic journey,

08:08.060 --> 08:09.850
因为这就是部电影  雷
'cause it is cinema, Ray.

08:09.850 --> 08:13.090
一部绝佳的电影
It's beautiful, beautiful cinema.

08:13.730 --> 08:16.840
现在  开机
Now, roll camera.

08:18.570 --> 08:21.110
我们的主角走进镜头
Enter our protagonist.

08:21.110 --> 08:23.240
他英俊潇洒  魅力四射
He's good-looking, he's gorgeous,

08:23.240 --> 08:26.870
正处于黄金年龄  是个风流倜傥的混蛋
he's golden age, he's a proper handsome cunt.

08:26.870 --> 08:30.690
他的名字叫做迈奇·皮尔森
His name is Mickey Pearson.

08:30.950 --> 08:33.000
我们迈奇的背景经历比较特殊
Unique background has our Mickey.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.140
他生在美国  得过罗德奖学金
American born, Rhodes scholar,

08:35.140 --> 08:37.690
可以说他很聪明  但出身贫穷
so he's born clever but poor.

08:35.550 --> 08:38.480
牛津大学
无条件录取通知书

08:37.960 --> 08:40.800
从美国的拖车公园  脱胎换骨
Now, that's quite a leap from a trailer park in Americana

08:40.800 --> 08:43.840
纵身来到英格兰有着千年历史的大学学府
to the thousand-year-old university in old Angleterre,

08:43.840 --> 08:47.090
学习园艺这门黑暗艺术
where he studies the dark art of horticulture.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.720
但他没能完成学业
But he never finished his education,

08:48.720 --> 08:50.790
也没有回家  因为...
never went home, because...

08:50.810 --> 08:52.770
他找到了自己的天职
he found his vocation.

08:52.770 --> 08:54.460
一个剑走偏锋的职业
A naughty vocation.

08:54.810 --> 08:56.250
他是个坏小子
He's a bad boy.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.270
他开始非法倒卖大麻
He starts dealing the dirty wonder weed

08:59.270 --> 09:02.610
贩卖给他那些富有的英国上流社会的大学同学
to his rich, British, upper-class uni pals

09:02.610 --> 09:05.050
然后他意识到自己还挺擅长这个的
and realizes he's rather good at it.

09:05.070 --> 09:08.030
他头脑清楚  目标明确  野心勃勃
He's clear and objective about ambition

09:08.030 --> 09:11.770
应对我国复杂文化下的各个阶层都游刃有余
and he can surf the echelons of our complicated culture.

09:12.870 --> 09:16.440
他知道如何利用自己的优势
He knew how to take advantage of his advantage.

09:18.670 --> 09:20.000
他是头饥饿的野兽
He was a hungry animal, you see.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.260
他强大  无情  狡猾  机敏
He was powerful and ruthless, cunning and quick,

09:23.260 --> 09:26.090
魅力非凡  聪明绝顶  但是...
charismatic and smart, but...

09:26.090 --> 09:28.840
只能做些非法勾当才有了今天的成就
he had to do some naughty things to get where he got,

09:28.850 --> 09:30.510
奠定了自己地位
to establish his position,

09:30.510 --> 09:33.580
证明了自己不仅仅只有一具好皮囊
to show he wasn't just teeth, tits and tan.

09:34.350 --> 09:36.500
他可不是徒有其表  对吧
Well, he wasn't fucking hollow, was he?

09:38.690 --> 09:40.520
他如同上了发条一般转个不停
He had an engine under his hood

09:40.520 --> 09:43.340
手起刀落
and a gun in his holster.

09:45.320 --> 09:48.030
所以说  我们的迈奇并不清白
So, he's not exactly clean, our Mickey.

09:48.030 --> 09:49.870
他是一路摸爬滚打上来的
He has come up the hard way.

09:49.870 --> 09:52.740
可以说他为自己争取来了今日的地位
He's earned his position, shall we say.

09:52.740 --> 09:54.290
那都是早期的事了
Well, that was the early days,

09:54.290 --> 09:57.860
随后他凭借自己开创新世界的精神一路高歌猛进
and he cracked on with his New World pioneer spirit.

09:58.330 --> 10:02.040
如今他身家多少  一亿  两亿  五亿
What's he worth today? 100, 200, 500 million?

10:02.040 --> 10:04.710
但如今  情节开始复杂起来
But now the plot begins to thicken.

10:04.710 --> 10:07.410
他走到了人生的十字路口
He has reached a crossroads in his life.

10:07.470 --> 10:10.140
他现在人到中年  身处中产阶级
The middle class and the middle age, they've got to him.

10:10.140 --> 10:13.560
这些消磨了他对危险的向往  他不再暴戾乖张
They've corrupted his appetite for the horrors. He's gone soft.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.430
他想套现产业  金盆洗手
He wanted to cash in his chips and get out of the game,

10:16.430 --> 10:19.230
而且他似乎找到了完美的接手者
and he seems to have found the perfect customer.

10:19.230 --> 10:20.960
麻烦跳切一下...
Smash cut, please...

10:21.150 --> 10:23.190
跳到室内  一场晚宴上
to interior, a gala dinner.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.190
我就简单说两句  感谢迈克尔·皮尔森
Just a few words to say thank you to Michael Pearson

10:26.190 --> 10:28.990
谢谢他无限的慷慨和时间
for his limitless generosity and time.

10:28.990 --> 10:33.580
迈奇和博学多识  胸怀宽广的马修·伯格
Now, Mickey has been cultivating a special relationship

10:33.580 --> 10:37.910
一直在培养一种特殊的关系
with the erudite, learned and broad-minded Matthew Berger.

10:37.910 --> 10:41.290
没错  雷蒙德  我知道这位了不起的犹太亿万富翁
Yes, Raymond, I do know about the Jewish billionaire cowboy,

10:41.290 --> 10:44.630
又是一个美国人在英格兰制造闹剧的例子
another slice of Americana creating drama in Angleterre.

10:44.630 --> 10:48.670
最后感谢马修·伯格的意外捐赠
And finally to Matthew Berger blindsiding us with his donation

10:48.670 --> 10:52.240
资助我们建立起认知行为治疗法小组
to build the entire cognitive behavioral therapy unit.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.850
这两人早已熟识  鬼知道是在哪认识的
So these two have met before. Fuck knows where.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.720
我猜是在拉斯维加斯的
Presumably at the annual international

10:56.720 --> 10:58.810
年度全球毒贩大会上吧
drug dealers convention in Las Vegas.

10:58.810 --> 11:01.060
他们一起做过一些小生意
And they've done some small deals together,

11:01.060 --> 11:03.590
但如今他俩准备干一票大的
but now they're ready for the big one.

11:03.610 --> 11:06.800
真没想到  马修
Well, that was unexpected, Matthew.

11:07.150 --> 11:09.440
现在我算是明白你为什么坐在主座了
Now I understand why you're seated at the head of the table.

11:09.450 --> 11:12.180
这事都不告诉我吗  你这个小淘气
Snuck that one right by me, didn't you, you naughty little girl?

11:12.410 --> 11:14.570
在上流社会引起轰动
Making a splash with the gentry.

11:14.580 --> 11:17.140
我怎么会错过这样的机会
Oh, I like to make a splash whenever possible.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.250
你似乎也明白
Well, you also seem to understand

11:19.250 --> 11:21.500
衣着得体的重要性
the significance of a proper attire.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.900
我确实明白
Indeed I do.

11:22.920 --> 11:26.210
我相信生活中主人翁精神在各个方面都至关重要
I believe a sense of ownership is vital in every aspect of life,

11:26.210 --> 11:28.910
或许在衣着上尤为如此
perhaps never more so than when it comes to wardrobe.

11:28.970 --> 11:30.760
每套穿搭都有自己的流行期
For every look there is a season,

11:30.760 --> 11:32.590
而每一季潮流中都包含着策略
and for every season a strategy.

11:32.590 --> 11:34.950
高手开始过招
Now starts the alpha dance.

11:35.260 --> 11:37.060
他们并不是在聊衣服  雷蒙德
They're not really talking about clothes, Raymond.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.680
当然不是了
Oh, fucking no.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.430
他们就像两条老狗
They're like a pair of old doggies

11:40.430 --> 11:43.060
相互闻着对方的智慧的屁眼
sniffing round one another's intellectual assholes.

11:43.060 --> 11:46.020
这是老派的决斗  雷蒙德
It's a good old-fashioned cock-off, Raymond.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.840
迈克尔  希望我们能一起做生意
Michael, I'm looking forward to doing business together.

11:49.150 --> 11:51.720
-请允许我们先失陪了  -请吧
- May we excuse ourselves? - Yes, please.

11:52.530 --> 11:54.470
我们该去和主人道个别
We should say good night to our host.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.480
你怎么想的
So what do you think?

12:01.040 --> 12:02.230
不好说
I'm not sure.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.080
大人
Your Grace.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.330
他是只狐狸
He's a fox,

12:05.330 --> 12:07.380
狐狸天性狡猾
and foxes have a predictable nature.

12:07.380 --> 12:09.250
犹太人看犹太人很准的
Trust this Jew about that Jew.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.380
如果你放他进鸡窝
If you let him in the henhouse,

12:10.380 --> 12:12.780
自然是鸡飞狗跳血流满地了
you can expect blood and feathers everywhere.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.340
某次农场猎野鸡活动后
Fresh from a farmyard pheasant shoot,

12:16.350 --> 12:19.210
这两位开始喜欢上对方了
these two are starting to like each other.

12:19.270 --> 12:22.060
交谈甚欢  雷  一见如故
It's looking good, Ray. It's looking fucking good.

12:22.060 --> 12:24.460
你对企业的管理让我叹为观止
I'm impressed with what you've done with your enterprise.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.020
我绞尽脑汁也想不出你是怎么做到的
You see, try as I might, I can't work out how you do it,

12:27.020 --> 12:28.510
种叶子还是我的专职
and bush is my game.

12:28.690 --> 12:31.480
怎么能有人神不知鬼不觉地
How does anyone grow 50 tons of super skunk

12:31.490 --> 12:33.650
种了五十吨的超级臭鼬[大麻品种]without letting anyone else know how they do it?

12:33.650 --> 12:36.070
听你这么说我真是受宠若惊  马修
I'm flattered to hear that from you, Matthew.

12:36.070 --> 12:38.740
我猜你一定绞尽脑汁
I imagine that big brain of yours is sweating a stream of tears

12:38.740 --> 12:40.370
想弄明白这件事
just trying to figure it out.

12:40.370 --> 12:42.020
你确实很有才华
Brilliance should be acknowledged.

12:43.210 --> 12:44.900
再跟我算算账
Run the numbers by me again.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.790
每年总收入两亿  净利润一亿
200 million gross p.a., 100 million net.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.170
这个你的人已经知道了
But your people know this already.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.450
几个月前他们就摸清这些数据了
They've swept the numbers for months now.

12:52.510 --> 12:56.620
关键是我要以四亿的价格卖给你
The bottom line is I'll sell it to you for 400 million.

13:03.020 --> 13:05.340
但这一点你也早就知道了  上车
But you knew that already. Hop in.

13:05.390 --> 13:08.130
具体交易细节我不能说
Now, I can't be specific about the heroes and zeros,

13:08.150 --> 13:10.690
总之牵涉到一大笔钱
but there was a lot of money hanging in the balance.

13:10.690 --> 13:14.400
提问  有能毁掉这样的一次行动的能力
Question: What would it be worth to have the power

13:14.400 --> 13:16.990
可以值多少钱
to be able to pull the plug on an operation like that?

13:16.990 --> 13:21.160
回答  贪心的人会想要售价的一半
Answer: A greedy man would want half the sale price,

13:21.160 --> 13:24.370
但聪明的人知道两千万
but a smart man would know that 20 million pounds

13:24.370 --> 13:26.290
虽然算是出了一点血
was just about uncomfortable enough

13:26.290 --> 13:28.070
但能让大家都开心
to make everyone feel comfortable.

13:28.670 --> 13:31.920
你可真是老奸巨猾别出心裁  弗莱彻
You're a cunning and creative toad, aren't you, Fletcher,

13:31.920 --> 13:33.710
打着这么个算盘
coming up with a plan like this?

13:33.710 --> 13:35.880
是  但这计划并不是我想出来的吧
Yeah, but I didn't really come up with it, did I?

13:35.880 --> 13:37.260
是大戴夫
It was Big Dave.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.090
他委托我调查迈奇
He commissioned me to do a job on Mickey,

13:39.100 --> 13:40.760
打探他的动向  盯盯梢
you know, sniff about, keep an eye on him,

13:40.760 --> 13:43.260
翻翻垃圾桶  揭露他的罪行
go through his bins, reveal his sins.

13:43.270 --> 13:46.180
迈奇·皮尔森  可恶的美国流氓
Mickey Pearson, the odious Yankee gangster.

13:46.180 --> 13:47.500
我们要毁了他
We're gonna bury him.

13:47.690 --> 13:49.960
因为他似乎交到了个新朋友
Because it seems he's got himself a new friend.

13:50.190 --> 13:51.730
普雷斯菲尔德勋爵
Lord Pressfield.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.930
提问  是那位普雷斯菲尔德勋爵吗
Question: Is that the Lord Pressfield?

13:55.150 --> 13:56.490
那位公爵大人
His Grace, the duke?

13:56.490 --> 13:59.030
没错  曾经的王位第四顺位继承人
Yeah. Once fourth in line to the throne.

13:59.030 --> 14:01.030
原来迈奇·皮尔森是靠
Apparently Mickey Pearson has squeaked his way

14:01.030 --> 14:03.690
伺候他那高贵的肥屁股上位的
into the crack of his fat, posh ass.

14:04.450 --> 14:05.660
这活归你了  弗莱彻
This is yours, Fletcher.

14:05.660 --> 14:07.910
我需要你这样有创意  嗅觉灵敏的人
I need a man with your creativity, with your nose.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.750
你知道你是我最爱的警犬
Now, you know you're my favorite bloodhound.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.670
我觉得你真的非常应该
I just think it's really important to remember

14:11.670 --> 14:13.490
记住你在跟谁说话  戴夫
who you're talking to, Dave.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.340
我当然会记得  弗莱彻
Of course I remember, Fletcher.

14:15.340 --> 14:16.550
所以这次的支票
So just make absolutely sure

14:16.550 --> 14:18.530
千万不要让我失望
the check doesn't disappoint this time.

14:19.260 --> 14:21.500
我要十五万
The number is 150,000.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.210
他想搞垮他
He wants to ruin him,

14:24.470 --> 14:27.580
但我是来帮你一把的
but I am here to do you a favor.

14:28.690 --> 14:31.340
你的钱也不会打水漂
And it's not like you're not getting something for your money.

14:30.660 --> 14:33.440
《叶子》
剧本草稿
弗莱彻作

14:31.480 --> 14:34.680
你甚至可以把那剧本拍成电影  雷蒙德
You could even turn that script into a feature film, Raymond.

14:35.070 --> 14:38.550
我们可以合作  成为搭档
We could make it together. We could be partners.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.810
我可太了解你了
I have learned off you lot.

14:40.990 --> 14:44.770
你凡事都以己为先  现在轮到我了
You gotta look after number one, and now it's my turn.

14:45.620 --> 14:49.230
我已经日薄西山了  雷
The sun is not going up for me, Ray. It's going down.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.790
大戴夫怎么就和我的老板结了仇
So why has Big Dave got it in for my boss?

14:53.790 --> 14:56.090
两个月前  你的迈奇
Two months ago, your man Mickey

14:56.090 --> 14:58.920
把我的戴夫当成白痴
made my man Dave feel like a right fucking idiot.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.740
亨利  迈奇
Henry. Mickey.

15:00.930 --> 15:02.220
他做了什么
How did he do that?

15:02.220 --> 15:03.600
拒绝跟他握手
Didn't accept his hand.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.580
-戴夫  《日报》的  -对
- Dave. Daily Print. - Yes.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.430
不  《日报》的编辑
No. Editor of the Daily Print.

15:08.430 --> 15:11.390
原来戴夫爆了迈奇一位主子的料
Turns out Dave had gone after one of Mickey's lords,

15:11.400 --> 15:13.520
大肆报道他的花边新闻
did a proper tabloid job on him.

15:13.310 --> 15:17.520
同性恋爵爷和管家姘居

15:13.520 --> 15:15.980
这位勋爵似乎和他身边那位帅气的年轻男仆
It would appear that His Lordship had had a quick spin

15:15.980 --> 15:18.260
有过一段露水之缘
on one of his attractive young footmen.

15:17.690 --> 15:20.480
勋爵痛失董事会席位和庄园

15:18.360 --> 15:19.940
那篇报道之后  股价暴跌
After the splash, shares crashed,

15:19.940 --> 15:21.240
他丢了工作  接着妻子离开了他
job went, wife followed,

15:20.600 --> 15:23.150
妻子离开同性恋勋爵

15:21.240 --> 15:23.220
连他的孩子都跟他断绝了关系
and even his kids disowned him.

15:23.370 --> 15:25.810
这全拜戴夫所赐
Well, that Dave can't half be a cunt.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.660
但没人敢把矛头指向他
But no one will pull him on it.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.580
他们太害怕戴夫会写八卦文章报复他们
Too fucking scared that Dave will do a feature on them.

15:30.580 --> 15:33.670
但你的迈奇  他胆子可太大了
But your Mickey, he's got a fabulous set of balls.

15:33.670 --> 15:35.420
所以他当着一群戴夫渴望跻身其中的名流的面
So he snubbed him in front of a crowd

15:35.420 --> 15:37.000
让他吃了个闭门羹
that Dave could only wish he belonged to.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.670
都是些贵族名媛
You know, lords and ladies, the sort that

15:38.670 --> 15:40.910
迈奇跟他们倒是非常熟络
Mickey feels very comfortable in front of.

15:41.130 --> 15:43.050
各位失陪了
Men, excuse us.

15:43.050 --> 15:45.010
他还不如直接把戴夫的老二给扯下来
Well, he might just as well have pulled Dave's cock off.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.180
你真是碰了一鼻子灰  戴夫
I do believe that was a bit of a fuck off, Dave.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.580
因为他灰头土脸就像撒了气的气球
'Cause he just fizzled like a party balloon.

15:50.060 --> 15:51.810
不能因为这个就去杀人吧
That's no reason to go after a fella.

15:51.810 --> 15:54.500
我不知道该怎么跟你说  他想看见迈奇流血
Well, I don't know what to tell you. He wants Mickey's blood.

15:54.730 --> 15:58.300
他本来能得手的  如果不是...
And he would be getting it too, if it wasn't for...

15:59.320 --> 16:02.740
你是个无耻的幻想狂  你该走了
You're a filthy fantasist, and now it's time to leave.

16:02.740 --> 16:06.320
别说傻话  这才是前戏
Oh, don't be silly. I'm only just lubing you up.

16:06.330 --> 16:09.830
马修  或任何人
Now, there is a reason

16:09.830 --> 16:11.120
都想不通迈奇是怎么做到的
why Matthew, or anyone else for that matter,

16:11.120 --> 16:14.070
其中必有隐情
cannot work out how Mickey does what he does.

16:14.380 --> 16:18.250
他是怎么每年种出五十吨"白寡妇超级奶酪"的
How does he grow 50 tons of white widow super cheese every year?

16:18.250 --> 16:20.260
大家都知道  那需要很大的占地面积
Everyone knows that needs a lot of space.

16:20.260 --> 16:24.010
所以这个地方在哪  他是怎么不被人发现的
So where is the space and how come he's kept it under wraps?

16:24.010 --> 16:25.550
你不能在地上挖个坑
You can't just dig a hole in the ground

16:25.100 --> 16:28.860
邓肯勋爵
九号庄园

16:25.550 --> 16:27.220
往里面放两百个集装箱
and drop 200 shipping containers in there.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.970
不行的  亲爱的  行不通的
Oh, no, my love. That will not work.

16:28.970 --> 16:33.020
你得有点创意  换个角度思考
No. You have to be creative. You need an angle.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.840
这个国家的土地的问题在于  土地匮乏
The problem with land in this country is there's not much of it...

16:35.770 --> 16:36.860
欧洲

16:36.940 --> 16:40.260
哪怕本应是私人领地的地方  公众也能进入
and there's public access even when it's supposed to be private.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.280
加拿大
美国

16:40.480 --> 16:43.720
公众有权利  遛狗的人
And the public have rights... Dog walkers...

16:43.950 --> 16:45.260
加油啊
Yes, jog on.

16:45.290 --> 16:46.440
公众步道

16:45.410 --> 16:48.030
公共小径  人人有权随意来往
...footpaths, right to roam,

16:48.030 --> 16:49.490
漫游闲逛的人
bimblers, ramblers,

16:49.490 --> 16:50.810
獾爱好者
badger lovers...

16:51.410 --> 16:53.710
闲的没事干的管事婆
and any other busy cunt with enough time on his hands

16:52.370 --> 16:54.650
管事婆

16:53.710 --> 16:55.120
监视着英格兰绿地上的一举一动
to sniff the green tweed of England.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.020
早上好
Good morning!

16:56.750 --> 17:02.130
他们有小组  论坛  线下聚会  社交媒体
And they have groups, forums, meetings, social media,

17:02.130 --> 17:04.260
他们喜欢闲话家常
and they love a good chat and a hiss about anyone

17:02.270 --> 17:02.640
天啊  又是他

17:03.100 --> 17:03.560
再聚一次

17:03.560 --> 17:04.100
再聚一次

17:04.260 --> 17:07.080
在没领许可证就修剪草坪的人背后指指点点
who's decided to mow his lawn without a license.

17:08.010 --> 17:11.350
还有直升机  无人机  谷歌地球
And then there's the helicopters, drones, Google Earth,

17:11.350 --> 17:15.090
文物遗址  教区议会  等等等等
heritage sites, parish councils, and the beat goes on.

17:15.690 --> 17:18.710
还没想到接管这里就有这么多麻烦
And that's before you even think about getting power in here.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.780
所以迈奇究竟用了什么独特的方法
So what is Mickey's unique method?

17:23.780 --> 17:28.310
我向脸颊  向优雅  向品味致敬
I tip my cap at the cheek, at the elegance, at the class.

17:29.030 --> 17:30.990
那是什么独特方法
And what would that method be exactly?

17:30.990 --> 17:33.850
要了解一个人首先得理解他的文化
You have to understand a culture to understand a man.

17:34.160 --> 17:38.940
纨绔子弟  贵族  公爵  女公爵  爵爷和贵妇
Toffs, aristocrats, dukes, duchesses, lords and ladies,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.340
大片土地大把金钱
lots of land and fuck all dough.

17:41.340 --> 17:44.990
有宅邸要管  湿气要除  银器要擦
Houses to keep, damp to keep out, silver to polish.

17:45.300 --> 17:48.180
要知道  现金对于那些被愤怒的左翼分子和遗产税
You must remember that cash is very persuasive

17:48.180 --> 17:51.960
教训过的人来说是非常有说服力的
to the class that got spanked by angry lefties and death duties.

17:52.770 --> 17:56.500
每次继承一大笔财富  都要把一半上交给国家
And every time you inherit a fortune, you lose half to the state.

17:56.690 --> 18:01.020
这时我就要像守护天使一样冲上去
So this is my moment to swoop in like a guardian fucking angel

18:01.020 --> 18:04.510
提供服务  帮他们把宅邸安排得井然有序
and offer my services so they can keep their houses in order.

18:04.570 --> 18:06.680
只要现金每年源源不断地入账
And they're not too bothered about what I do,

18:07.150 --> 18:10.140
他们就不太关心我做什么
as long as that cash keeps rolling in each year.

18:10.410 --> 18:12.930
拉到贵族客户固然好  但并不容易
It's good to get a lord, yes, but it's not easy.

18:13.240 --> 18:16.940
需要下功夫  美酒  女人和迪斯科
It takes work, wine, women and disco.

18:17.670 --> 18:20.460
十二个种植点  十二座农场
Twelve sites. Twelve farms.

18:20.460 --> 18:23.460
全英国有一千座这样的庄园
One thousand of these estates in the great UK.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.700
想一网打尽  祝你好运
Bonne chance trying to find them all.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.830
这就是我的产业架构
That's it. My infrastructure.

18:30.680 --> 18:35.420
尊敬的先生  你花钱买的就是这个
And that, sir, is, with my blessing, what you are paying for.

18:36.060 --> 18:39.020
如果它如你所言的那样隐蔽  利润丰厚
If it's as discreet and as lucrative as you claim it is,

18:39.020 --> 18:40.630
我要全盘买下
I'll buy the whole business.

18:40.810 --> 18:42.670
我受够了前戏  迈克尔
But enough foreplay, Michael.

18:43.110 --> 18:44.840
我要看看你种的大麻
I wanna see your plant.

18:46.940 --> 18:49.070
我花了大力气让我的行动
I've gone to great lengths to make my operation

18:49.070 --> 18:51.560
尽可能地隐蔽  马修
as invisible as possible, Matthew.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.230
就算我的叶子就在你脚下  你也不会察觉
If you were standing on my bush, you wouldn't know it.

18:56.450 --> 18:59.900
事实上  你现在正站在我的叶子上
As a matter of fact, you are standing on my bush.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.990
真是蔚为壮观啊  迈克尔
It's a spectacular business, Michael.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.840
真是可惜  等这玩意在英国合法化
Such a shame it will go bankrupt in ten years

19:07.840 --> 19:09.870
这行就要破产了
when things go legal in the great UK.

19:10.510 --> 19:12.830
你要我出高价买下
And you want me to pay top dollar for it?

19:13.140 --> 19:15.330
不到半码
A nugget under half a yard?

19:13.230 --> 19:16.940
不到五亿

19:16.430 --> 19:17.830
就是这个价
That is the price.

19:18.730 --> 19:21.920
请进  我给你看看这五亿能买到什么
Now step inside and I'll show you what half a yard gets you.

19:27.990 --> 19:31.100
价值四亿美元的可爱工棚
A delightful tool shed for 400 million dollars.

19:31.660 --> 19:33.490
圆头锤包含在价格内吗
Is the ball-peen hammer included?

19:33.490 --> 19:36.560
当然了  我带你去看看钉子
Course it is. Now let me show you the nails.

19:44.460 --> 19:45.530
小心碰头
Watch your head.

19:46.340 --> 19:47.610
继续忙  小伙子们
Carry on, chaps.

19:58.850 --> 20:01.590
英国的宜人绿地
England's green and pleasant land.

20:03.310 --> 20:04.920
这些"钉子"不错
Those are some nails.

20:06.060 --> 20:09.380
选址  员工  科技
Location, staff, technology.

20:09.940 --> 20:13.850
瞧  你是为了未来的上层建筑买下了下层建筑
See, you're buying the substructure for the superstructure to come,

20:14.490 --> 20:18.180
付款后  你将继承最好的种植点
and with purchase you will inherit the best sites available,

20:18.370 --> 20:21.700
全世界最优秀的植物学家和大麻品鉴师
the finest botanists and herb sommeliers in the world,

20:21.710 --> 20:25.530
以及全球最具创新性的大麻科技
as well as the most innovative marijuana technology on the planet.

20:26.290 --> 20:28.950
等这生意合法化了
And when this little piggy goes to legal market

20:29.050 --> 20:32.200
需求远远大于供给
and the demand way outpaces the supply...

20:33.010 --> 20:36.590
这些种植地  这些技艺高超的园丁们
these locations, these green-fingered botanical boys,

20:36.600 --> 20:38.790
还有我的先进科技
as well as my superior technology,

20:38.970 --> 20:40.460
将会溢价
will be at a premium.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.080
而这一切都将归你所有
And you would own them all.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.290
你知道吗  在美国
Did you know it took 15 years

20:48.290 --> 20:50.150
禁酒令废除后
after alcohol prohibition ended back home

20:50.150 --> 20:52.180
合法市场花了十五年才填补了供需缺口
for the legal market to scratch that itch?

20:53.030 --> 20:54.890
十五年
Fifteen years.

20:55.450 --> 20:57.390
这还是没人出手的情况
And that's if you do nothing with it.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.100
没错  不管怎么看都是双赢
Yes, it's a win-win, no matter how you look at it.

21:02.450 --> 21:04.790
我不贪心  你和我都知道
And I'm not greedy. You and I both know

21:04.790 --> 21:08.280
四亿再良心不过了
that 400 million is a fair-to-generous asking price,

21:09.040 --> 21:11.590
尤其是考虑到一旦合法化
especially considering that once this game's kosher,

21:11.590 --> 21:14.920
价值就能升到两千亿
it's going to be worth somewhere between 200 billion and,

21:14.930 --> 21:17.620
到五千亿英镑之间
well, half a trillion pounds.

21:18.180 --> 21:19.250
每年
Annually.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.000
大麻
Weed.

21:21.470 --> 21:22.830
叶子
Bush.

21:23.270 --> 21:25.000
阿莫拉臭鼬
Skunk-amola.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.920
白寡妇超级奶酪
White widow super cheese.

21:29.270 --> 21:30.760
这是一场新的淘金潮
It's the new gold rush.

21:31.820 --> 21:34.930
这是赚大钱的一线机会
This is the thin end of a very fat wedge, sir.

21:35.570 --> 21:38.720
既然是赚大钱  你为什么不自己留着
If it's such a fat wedge, why don't you keep it?

21:39.580 --> 21:41.490
我一路摸爬滚打
You see, I've developed a reputation

21:41.490 --> 21:43.940
已经声名在外了
as a man who came up the hard way.

21:44.620 --> 21:48.320
可以说我这双漂亮的白手上沾满了鲜血
You could say that there's blood on these pretty white hands.

21:48.750 --> 21:51.440
但对于新的行业  一旦合法化
But in the new business, once legal

21:51.440 --> 21:53.270
在内阁可观的
and under the jurisdiction of

21:53.270 --> 21:56.490
合法化保护伞之下
the respectable umbrella of ministerial legitimacy,

21:56.930 --> 22:01.050
做这行的企业需要有清白的过去
an enterprise like this will need a face with a clean past,

22:01.050 --> 22:03.790
很可惜我没有
which sadly I do not possess.

22:04.100 --> 22:06.000
退休似乎也不错
Retirement doesn't sound so bad.

22:06.270 --> 22:10.060
在郊外散步  和我的爱人修剪玫瑰
Long walks in the countryside, pruning roses with my better half,

22:10.060 --> 22:11.590
养养孩子
raising some cubs.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.130
这种生活是我应得的
I've earned it.

22:14.780 --> 22:19.180
我们都知道种植只是这项生意的一半
Look, we both know growing is only 50% of the business.

22:19.530 --> 22:21.720
我需要你在欧陆的人脉
I need your European connections.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.790
我见过香肠的生产过程了
I've seen how the sausage is made.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.020
现在给我讲讲肉店
Now tell me about the butcher shops.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.240
那之后再说  马修
Well, that comes later, Matthew,

22:28.740 --> 22:30.330
钱打进托管账户时再说
when the money's in escrow.

22:30.460 --> 22:34.030
既然我们的主人工困境已确立
Now that we've established the dilemma of our protagonist,

22:34.030 --> 22:37.710
现在就来看看咱们的反派角色
let us turn to our antagonist.

22:37.710 --> 22:40.750
很远之外  越过开阔的平原
Many miles away, across the open plains,

22:40.750 --> 22:46.240
另一头凶猛野兽奔向一个水坑
another beautiful feral beast lopes his way to a watering hole.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.630
你现在说的是谁
Who are you talking about now?

22:47.630 --> 22:51.580
雷蒙德  我说的是干眼
I talk, Raymondo, of Dry Eye.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.160
干眼啊
Oh, Dry Eye.

22:53.160 --> 22:56.070
他是谁  是中国人  日本人  北京人
What is he? Chinese? Japanese? Pekingese?

22:56.070 --> 22:57.660
还是需要你下跪膜拜的人
Get on your fucking knees?

22:57.670 --> 22:59.380
邪恶的东方巨龙
Dirty dragon filth.

22:59.380 --> 23:02.620
黄色是他皮肤的颜色  赌博是他的拿手好戏
Yellow is his color, gambling is his game.

23:02.620 --> 23:06.740
他就像千禧年鞭炮一样爆炸登场
He explodes on the scene like a millennial fucking firecracker.

23:06.740 --> 23:07.770
砰砰砰
Bang, bang, bang.

23:07.770 --> 23:09.370
你们这群狗日的
You chee-bye motherfuckers!

23:09.370 --> 23:11.940
打断一下  弗莱彻
I'm gonna have to stop you right there, Fletcher.

23:11.940 --> 23:14.080
这可不像我认识的干眼
That doesn't sound like the Dry Eye I know.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.760
就是要你专心听好  雷蒙德
Just making sure you're paying attention, Raymond.

23:16.770 --> 23:20.300
我们直接跳到这位做事有点虎头蛇尾
So let's cut instead to a somewhat anticlimactic

23:20.300 --> 23:23.150
但又不失风度的干眼
but suave and debonair Dry Eye,

23:23.150 --> 23:25.270
他就像中国版詹姆斯·邦德
like a Chinese James Bond.

23:26.290 --> 23:28.100
《007之杀人饭桶》
"Ricense" to kill.

23:30.010 --> 23:31.590
-打开  -是  老大
- Open them up. - Yes, boss.

23:36.860 --> 23:38.510
天啊
Good Lord.

23:41.110 --> 23:44.000
给他们洗洗  把他们运走
Hose them down, load them up and fuck them off.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.850
-让我看一眼四三二  -是  老大  就在这里
- Let me have a look at 432. - Yes, boss. It's just right here.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.050
打开[粤语]

23:51.830 --> 23:56.240
一百二十个轮轴  三十二个LS发动机  六十个定制
There's 120 rims, uh, 32 LS engines, 60 custom...

23:56.240 --> 23:57.900
行了  给钱
All right. Pay the man.

23:58.060 --> 24:02.020
抱歉  之前的报价是六米的集装箱  这是十二米的
Sorry, chaps. I quoted you for a 20 when it's a 40-footer.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.170
钱要加倍
It's gonna be double bubble.

24:05.550 --> 24:06.670
加倍
Double bubble?

24:08.060 --> 24:11.860
君子一言驷马难追
A gentleman's quote is a gentleman's word.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.920
现在你或你的家人
Now, either you or your family

24:14.930 --> 24:16.960
要花钱买个教训了
are gonna have to pay for that lesson.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.100
明白了吗
Do we have an understanding?

24:21.020 --> 24:21.980
明白了  老大
Yes, boss.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.320
把钱给这个软蛋
Give the soppy prick his money.

24:28.810 --> 24:30.950
不管怎么说  干眼的故事先告一段落
Anyway, let's put a pin in Dry Eye

24:30.950 --> 24:33.080
我们再来看看迈奇
and turn again to Mickey.

24:33.590 --> 24:35.850
如果你想在这抽这个
If you're thinking of smoking that in here...

24:36.650 --> 24:37.560
打住
Don't.

24:37.710 --> 24:38.760
我没听明白
I find that confusing.

24:38.760 --> 24:42.600
你是指不要吸烟  还是不要想
Do you mean don't smoke or don't think?

24:48.600 --> 24:50.600
好了好了  灭了灭了
Oh, all right, all right, it's going out.

24:56.740 --> 25:00.790
岩石花卉
全天供应鲜花

25:08.650 --> 25:13.480
现在是时候向你介绍我们的女主了
I think the time has come for me to introduce you to our queen.

25:13.480 --> 25:14.790
哈罗德  包
Harold, bag.

25:14.790 --> 25:16.730
如果迈奇是美国牛仔版的凯撒大帝
A Cockney Cleopatra

25:16.730 --> 25:18.890
她就是伦敦东区的埃及艳后
to Mickey's cowboy Caesar.

25:18.890 --> 25:22.570
他那坚不可摧的盔甲上唯一的软肋
The only weak link in his otherwise impregnable armor

25:22.570 --> 25:26.530
就是他对他美丽妻子的忠诚与激情
is his devotion, his passion, some would say his obsession

25:26.530 --> 25:28.420
有人说那就是痴迷
with his beauteous lady wife.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.550
我正在帮你的忙  迈克
I'm trying to do you a favor here, Mike,

25:30.560 --> 25:33.450
但每次帮你  最后我还要倒贴
but every time I do you a favor, it ends up costing me too.

25:30.940 --> 25:32.450
接待处

25:33.460 --> 25:35.870
-拜托  罗莎  -为什么科娃小姐还在这里
- Now, come on, Ros... - Why is Miss Kova still here?

25:35.870 --> 25:37.850
那辆路虎揽胜应该早上就修好了
That Range was supposed to be finished this morning.

25:37.850 --> 25:39.170
我不是在跟你说话  迈克
I'm not talking to you, Mike.

25:39.170 --> 25:40.910
抱歉  老板  那辆是路虎是罗杰负责的
Sorry, boss. Rodge is on the Range.

25:41.100 --> 25:44.070
我跟你说了多少次  我不要罗杰出现在这
How many times have I told you? I don't want Roger up front.

25:44.070 --> 25:46.710
这里是女士圣殿  他在哪
This is a sanctuary for the ladies. Where is he?

25:46.710 --> 25:48.410
他和你丈夫在你的办公室里
He's up in your office with your husband.

25:51.650 --> 25:54.380
米莎  亲爱的  二十分钟后你就可以走了
Misha, darling, I'll have you out of here in 20 minutes.

25:54.390 --> 25:57.150
罗莎琳  我半个小时后有一节动感单车课
Rosalind, I've got a spin class in half an hour.

25:57.150 --> 25:59.010
再给我二十分钟  这次免单
Twenty minutes and no charge.

25:59.010 --> 26:00.700
丽萨  香槟
Lisa, champagne.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.630
-迈克  还在听吗  -我当然一直在听了
- Mike, are you still there? - Of course I'm still fucking here.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.080
好吧  如果你一直在听
Right, well, if you're still there,

26:05.080 --> 26:07.070
是谁在订购零件
who's ordering the fucking parts?

26:07.280 --> 26:08.350
你觉得怎么样
So what do you think?

26:08.350 --> 26:10.230
提个醒  但别太狠
Ringing the bell, but not too loud.

26:10.850 --> 26:12.060
再给点甜头
Dipped in honey.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.300
点到为止
That's on the money.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.990
但你总能处理得很完美  迈奇
But you always could make a good cup of tea, Mickey.

26:17.990 --> 26:18.950
非常好
Very nice.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.580
你好  罗莎
Hello, Ros.

26:22.460 --> 26:24.300
你们在干什么
What the fuck is going on in here?

26:24.430 --> 26:26.300
我早该知道是你搞的鬼
I should have known it was you behind this.

26:26.300 --> 26:27.780
罗杰应该在下面工作
Rodge is supposed to be working down there

26:27.780 --> 26:29.570
却被你叫上来洗脑
and you're up here blowing his brains out.

26:29.570 --> 26:31.440
-我马上去  老板  -赶紧的
- I'm on it, boss. - You wanna be.

26:31.850 --> 26:33.500
别怪道奇  亲爱的
Don't blame the Dodge, dear.

26:33.500 --> 26:34.900
你知道他消息灵通
You know he's got a special nose

26:34.900 --> 26:37.030
他是在帮我这个老朋友一个忙
and he's doing this old dog a favor.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.910
道奇  快下去干活赚钱
Dodge, get down there and earn your money.

26:38.740 --> 26:40.680
THC轮胎

26:38.950 --> 26:39.880
遵命
Gone.

26:42.510 --> 26:43.900
你来这里干什么
What you doing here anyway?

26:44.220 --> 26:46.540
我就是想来跟我的妻子喝杯茶
Thought I'd come by to have a cup of tea with my wife.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.140
行啊  去把水烧上
Well, go on, then. Put the kettle on.

26:52.030 --> 26:53.900
看来交易很顺利
Looks like the deal's gone through.

26:54.340 --> 26:56.660
-要再考虑一下吗  -不考虑了
- Second thoughts? - No second thoughts.

26:56.660 --> 26:58.210
我喜欢中年
I like middle age.

26:58.420 --> 27:01.920
我喜欢贵族生活  私立学校  醇酒佳酿
I like gentrification, private schools, fine wines

27:01.920 --> 27:05.810
和一勺送药的鱼子酱
and a spoonful of caviar to help my medicine go down.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.730
但最重要的是
But most importantly,

27:07.730 --> 27:09.740
我很期待更多与你相伴的时光
I'm looking forward to spending more time with you.

27:09.750 --> 27:10.910
当然了
Course you are.

27:11.980 --> 27:13.330
我不希望你在这无所事事
Look, I don't want you knocking around here

27:13.330 --> 27:15.890
游手好闲  迷失自我
feeling all unemployed and lost with yourself.

27:16.370 --> 27:17.930
见鬼了
Well, fuck me.

27:18.620 --> 27:20.170
大多数妻子都求着另一半
Most wives would beg their other halves

27:20.170 --> 27:22.140
金盆洗手  但你不一样
to get out of this game, but not you.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.880
那是因为我了解你  亲爱的
That's because I know you, darling.

27:24.730 --> 27:27.960
亲爱的  你得优雅地退场
Look, you'll have to do this elegantly, love.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.350
如果你退出的消息传开了
If word spreads that you're getting out,

27:30.350 --> 27:32.040
大家会认为你变弱了
that could read as weakness.

27:32.180 --> 27:34.710
你要是闻到了烟味  那是因为有人点着了火
And if you smell smoke, it's 'cause there's a fire,

27:34.710 --> 27:36.430
你可能会付出很大代价
and that could get expensive.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.710
所以得毫不留情地把火苗掐断
So you're gonna have to stamp that out without any gentrification.

27:40.650 --> 27:41.920
但不能由你来做  亲爱的
But not you, love.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.420
别乱来
Don't you do anything messy.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.170
你雇人就是来做这些的  还记得吗
That's why you've got people, remember?

27:48.450 --> 27:50.840
我爱死你了  宝贝
I fucking love you, babe.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.060
那还用说
Course you do.

27:52.980 --> 27:54.140
来一发吗
Any chance?

27:56.040 --> 27:57.410
不行  你等着吧
No, you can wait.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.200
有一个火辣的红发俄罗斯美女要发脾气了
I've got a red-hot Russki with her finger on the trigger.

28:00.200 --> 28:03.060
-我得去处理一下  -我不介意你们俩一起来
- Gotta deal with it. - I don't mind the two of yous.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.870
想得美  滚吧
Go on, fuck off.

28:06.840 --> 28:07.920
弗莱彻
Fletcher...

28:09.360 --> 28:11.380
为什么要浪费我们的时间
why are you wasting our time?

28:11.490 --> 28:14.010
我知道什么发生了  什么没发生
I know what happens in my world and what doesn't.

28:14.010 --> 28:17.280
我不懂的是为什么迈克尔
What I fail to recognize is why Michael should be motivated

28:17.280 --> 28:19.380
要给你写一张两千万的支票
to write you a check for 20 million.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.890
我发现你非常没有耐心  雷蒙德
I find you very impatient, Raymond.

28:21.890 --> 28:23.020
我是个讲故事的人
I am a storyteller.

28:23.030 --> 28:25.830
就像电影里的术语  我是在做铺垫
As they say in the film game, I'm laying pipe.

28:25.830 --> 28:28.140
你最好赶紧说点实质性的东西
Well, you'd better put something through it soon.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.150
那是什么  可以用来烤肉吗
So what is that? Is that a barbecue as well?

28:31.850 --> 28:34.650
-是的  没错  弗莱彻  -我喜欢户外烧烤
- Yes, it is, Fletcher. - I love a barbie.

28:35.230 --> 28:37.150
这装置真有用  不是吗
That is a useful bit of plant, then, isn't it?

28:37.150 --> 28:40.120
不仅能烤肉  还能暖暖膝盖
So that heats up your knees and cooks at the same time?

28:40.750 --> 28:42.640
告诉我在哪弄的
You gotta show me how to get one of them.

28:42.900 --> 28:45.470
你要是马上滚蛋  就能把它带走
Well, you can take it with you if you fuck off now.

28:46.390 --> 28:47.410
雷
Ray.

28:48.870 --> 28:50.530
可以帮我煎块牛排吗
Is there any chance of a steak?

28:56.240 --> 29:00.120
好吧  正好冰箱里有块和牛
Yeah, all right. Got a bit of Wagyu in the freezer as it happens.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.100
我从没吃过和牛
I've never had Wagyu.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.630
给你吃真是浪费  但我只有和牛
Yeah, well, it'll be wasted on you, but it's all I've got.

29:03.630 --> 29:05.680
-我去拿吧  朋友  -不  不用了
- I'll get it, mate. - Oh, no, you're all right.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.720
你就待在这里吧
Just stay right there.

29:10.170 --> 29:11.360
我靠
Ow, fuck me!

29:12.820 --> 29:13.860
小心烫
It's hot.

29:22.100 --> 29:24.950
那个弗莱彻真是只老狐狸
He's a sly fox, that Fletcher.

29:31.830 --> 29:33.410
晚安  阿斯兰
Night-night, Aslan.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.410
三十二个LS发动机
32 LS engines?

29:36.230 --> 29:38.970
所有零件都在这十二米的集装箱里吗
You got all these parts on a 40-foot container?

29:39.740 --> 29:40.670
是的
Yeah.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.860
你是怎么做到的
How'd you get your hands on that?

29:44.070 --> 29:46.400
别问了  问了我也不会说实话的
Ask no questions, hear no lies.

29:46.710 --> 29:48.050
开个价吧
Hence the price.

29:48.650 --> 29:51.130
-多少钱  -免费
- So how much? - Oh, no charge.

29:51.130 --> 29:53.330
好吧  代价是什么
Okay, so what's the price?

29:53.360 --> 29:54.570
跟你丈夫见一面
A meeting with your husband.

29:54.570 --> 29:56.040
算了吧
Oh, fuck off.

29:56.380 --> 29:57.860
这不可能
That's not gonna happen.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.550
他会感兴趣的
It's in his interest.

30:01.730 --> 30:06.170
这样吧  这些零件送你了  就当我略表心意
Tell you what, keep the parts. Consider it a gesture of goodwill.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.910
你知道怎么联系我
You know how to get hold of me.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.350
我不能承诺什么
Well, I can't promise anything.

30:13.350 --> 30:16.210
干眼和迈克尔谈过了  对吗
Dry Eye, he got his little sit-down with Michael, didn't he?

30:16.810 --> 30:20.120
无论是否得到龙头本人
Bold move, that, coming in heavy,

30:20.120 --> 30:23.490
乔治勋爵的批准
sanctioned or unsanctioned...

30:24.320 --> 30:27.620
这都是很大胆的行为
by the dragon head himself, Lord George.

30:28.090 --> 30:30.420
那个乔治不是省油的灯
Well, he's a naughty boy, that George.

30:30.730 --> 30:33.690
但干眼青出于蓝而胜于蓝
But Dry Eye, oh, he's next generation,

30:33.690 --> 30:37.000
还有那些中国佬  比苹果手机升级还快
and them Chinamen, they upgrade quicker than I-fucking-Phones.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.780
他要行动了吗
Is he making moves?

30:40.140 --> 30:41.960
他想自立门户吗
Is he breaking out on his own?

30:41.960 --> 30:45.430
背着乔治勋爵搞东搞西
Big man plans behind Lord George's back?

30:47.500 --> 30:48.700
说句公道话  他非常聪明地
To be fair, it was very nicely

30:48.700 --> 30:51.630
利用了价值十万美元的免费汽车零部件
played with 100 grand's worth of free car parts,

30:51.630 --> 30:52.660
因为众所周知
because everyone knows

30:52.660 --> 30:56.080
想要搞定一个男人  得从他的妻子下手
that the way to a man's heart is through his wife.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.840
你会是个不错的妻子  雷蒙德
You'd make a lovely wife, Raymond.

31:10.900 --> 31:13.540
谢谢你抽时间与我见面  迈克尔
Thank you for taking the time to see me, Michael.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.130
乔治勋爵向你问好
Lord George sends his best.

31:16.180 --> 31:19.020
我见你只是因为罗莎要我这么做
I only took this meeting because Ros asked me to.

31:19.020 --> 31:21.310
不要再像那样接近她了
Make sure to never approach her like that again.

31:21.610 --> 31:23.240
我无意冒犯
I meant no disrespect.

31:33.510 --> 31:34.560
找我有什么事
How can I help?

31:35.790 --> 31:37.490
我知道你准备抽身了
I understand you're getting out.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.990
抽身  抽什么身
Getting out. Getting out of what?

31:41.260 --> 31:43.510
起床  抽风  还是出柜
Bed? My head? The closet?

31:43.890 --> 31:46.590
别绕弯子了  干眼  我很忙
Don't flirt with me, Dry Eye. I'm a busy man.

31:46.590 --> 31:48.980
我听说你要金盆洗手了
I hear you're getting out of the game.

31:49.690 --> 31:53.250
我希望你考虑一下我的出价
And I would like you to consider an offer.

31:53.250 --> 31:54.770
这话就此打住
Look, I'm gonna stop you right there

31:54.770 --> 31:57.190
这样你就不必白费唇舌了  小伙子
so you don't waste any more of your precious breath, young man.

31:57.190 --> 31:59.590
这不是我们俩能谈论的话题
This is not a discussion for the two of us.

31:59.590 --> 32:01.020
不是什么都能像盐和胡椒粉一样
Unlike the salt and pepper,

32:01.020 --> 32:02.340
摆在明面上讨论
it's not on the table.

32:06.060 --> 32:08.410
我的出价很高
This is a big number.

32:30.630 --> 32:31.680
现金
Cash.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.840
我不是商品
I am not for sale.

32:37.860 --> 32:40.610
即便我是  你也还差好几个零
And even if I was, you're several zeros short.

32:40.610 --> 32:42.870
也许这些钱能够买下你手下的"香肠"
Now, you may be able to buy your man's sausage for that,

32:42.870 --> 32:45.230
但对我来说  早餐吃这个太不成体统了
but to me it just looks rude at breakfast.

32:47.970 --> 32:49.450
你落伍了
You're out of touch.

32:52.090 --> 32:55.400
你瞧不起我  这是忘记了丛林法则
You're forgetting the laws of the jungle, looking down on me.

33:00.460 --> 33:03.540
当强者只长岁数不长骨气时
Now, when the silverback's got more silver than back...

33:04.640 --> 33:09.710
最好趁着还没被赶走前  自行离开
he best move on... before he gets moved on.

33:10.630 --> 33:12.110
被赶走可不体面
It's not dignified.

33:12.990 --> 33:17.320
这不是你该有的眼界  迈克尔  我是在帮你
It's beneath you, Michael. Trying to do you a favor.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.090
这出价够高了
This is a big fucking number.

33:27.300 --> 33:28.340
而这
And this?

33:29.410 --> 33:31.520
这是一把好枪
This is a big fucking gun.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.880
现在眼睛不干了吧
Eyes not so dry now, are they?

33:43.770 --> 33:44.940
很痛  对吗
Hurts, does it?

33:46.410 --> 33:48.680
你在找你的蛋蛋还是墙上的洞
You looking for your balls or a hole in the wall?

33:48.680 --> 33:51.210
-操  -你觉得你能去哪
- Fuck! - Where the fuck do you think you're going?

33:51.720 --> 33:53.630
来了你就别想走出去
Because you're not going out the way you came in,

33:53.630 --> 33:55.750
你个满嘴谎言的孬种
you deluded duck-eating cunt.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.320
跟我说丛林法则
Talking to me about the laws of the jungle.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.920
那是什么  说我没有眼界
What was it? Something about being beneath me?

34:00.920 --> 34:02.700
岁数不饶人
Silver on back?

34:03.430 --> 34:06.040
这片丛林只有一条法则
There's only one rule in this fucking jungle.

34:06.340 --> 34:09.800
狮子饿了  就会大开杀戒
When the lion's hungry, he eats.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.710
你错了  弗莱彻
You're wrong, Fletcher.

34:12.710 --> 34:14.260
迈克尔的行事风格并非如此
That's not how Michael works.

34:14.260 --> 34:17.120
对  我知道  我只是加点乐子
Yeah, I know. I know. I was just having a bit of fun.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.620
每部电影都需要点动作戏  不是吗
Every movie needs a bit of action, doesn't it?

34:19.620 --> 34:21.650
迈克尔又不是没有声明在外
And it's not like Michael doesn't have a reputation.

34:21.650 --> 34:23.520
那是之前
Had a reputation.

34:24.060 --> 34:25.630
他现在变绅士了
He's been gentrified.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.630
出价够高了
...big fucking number.

34:32.930 --> 34:34.520
我知道你们很喜欢寓言
I know how you lot love fables,

34:34.520 --> 34:37.980
我就跟你讲一则寓言故事吧
so let me share a little fable with you.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.320
从前有一条年少无知的龙
There once was a young and foolish dragon

34:41.320 --> 34:43.980
去向一头聪明狡猾的狮子
who came to ask a wise and cunning lion

34:43.980 --> 34:45.830
询问怎样夺取自己的领地
about acquiring his territory.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.280
而狮子不感兴趣
Now, the lion, he wasn't interested,

34:47.280 --> 34:49.510
于是叫那条小龙滚蛋
so he told the little dragon to fuck off.

34:50.510 --> 34:53.090
但那条龙不懂"滚蛋"是什么意思
But the dragon couldn't understand what "fuck off" meant,

34:53.090 --> 34:56.110
他不依不饶地问狮子
so he persisted and continued to ask the lion

34:56.120 --> 34:58.160
怎么夺取领地
about acquiring his territory.

34:58.160 --> 35:01.040
于是狮子带着小龙去散步
So the lion took the little dragon for a walk

35:01.040 --> 35:03.850
朝他的小龙头打了五枪
and put five bullets in his little dragon head.

35:05.490 --> 35:06.710
故事讲完了
End of story.

35:09.610 --> 35:12.440
这个故事告诉人们一个道理
Now, allegedly there's a message in there.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.610
我不知道是什么  但你是个聪明的孩子  干眼
I don't know what it is, but you're a clever boy, Dry Eye.

35:15.610 --> 35:18.380
也许你能告诉我
Maybe you can explain it to me.

35:19.490 --> 35:21.320
时间到了  小伙子
I think your time's up, chaps.

35:22.420 --> 35:25.380
迈克尔  你应该重新...
Michael, you should recons...

35:27.330 --> 35:28.640
好好想想
Just marinade on it.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.810
现在可以滚了
In the meantime, fuck off.

35:36.060 --> 35:39.510
要我说  迈奇一定很高兴见了干眼  不是吗
Oh, I bet Mickey was pleased he took that meeting, wasn't he?

35:39.510 --> 35:41.350
是的  进展非常顺利
Yes, it went very well.

35:41.900 --> 35:44.270
-果然  -你要上面还是下面
- Yeah. - Do you want the top or the bottom?

35:44.320 --> 35:45.960
下面  亲爱的
The bottom, please, darling.

35:46.830 --> 35:49.500
那次见面后  有些事情开始浮出了水面
Now, things started to unravel after that meeting.

35:49.500 --> 35:52.700
迈奇的一个农场不是被几只老鼠骚扰过吗
Didn't Mickey get a rat infestation at one of his farms?

35:52.570 --> 35:57.160
尖峰鲜鱼公司
上等鲜鱼供应商

35:58.690 --> 35:59.650
快

我的天啊
Oh, my days.

36:22.220 --> 36:24.030
见鬼了
Fucking hell.

36:24.340 --> 36:26.090
他说过这里会有点大麻
He said there'd be a bit of puff.

36:26.090 --> 36:27.560
他们不是在开玩笑
Yeah, they weren't joking.

36:28.530 --> 36:31.650
伙计们  这些已经包装好了
Oi, fellas. It's already packed.

36:31.650 --> 36:32.890

36:37.100 --> 36:38.430

Don't. Cover up.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.700
你们知道这是谁的地盘吗
Do you know who owns this gaff?

36:40.710 --> 36:42.390
关我们屁事
We don't give a fuck.

36:42.430 --> 36:44.260
你们来错地方了
I think you got off on the wrong stop.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.570

他把我打晕了
He sparked me out, bruv.

38:57.970 --> 39:00.580
醒醒吧  各位  生活节奏很快  你们太慢了
Now, wake up, lads. Life's quick, you're slow.

39:00.610 --> 39:02.340
生活本艰难
Life's hard on a bone top.

39:03.300 --> 39:06.120
来趟拳馆  我看看怎么教教你们
Come on down the gym. We'll see what we can do with yous.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.180
等等  你就是那个教练吗
Hang on. Are you the coach?

39:15.950 --> 39:17.240
教练  是厄尼
Coach, it's Ernie.

39:18.110 --> 39:21.780
见鬼  他就是那个教练  那个大名鼎鼎的教练
Shit. It's the fucking coach, bro. It's the fucking coach.

39:21.780 --> 39:22.850
厄尼  怎么了
Ernie, what is it?

39:23.100 --> 39:24.700
大功告成
Ball's in the back of the net.

39:25.250 --> 39:26.290
我们打赢了
We've rung the bell here

39:26.290 --> 39:29.050
会算你一份的  因为你是我们的导师
and we're gonna include you, because you're our mentor.

39:29.090 --> 39:30.110
我没听懂你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about,

39:30.110 --> 39:31.690
但你的语气让我紧张
but I don't like the sound of it.

39:31.690 --> 39:35.780
-我们搞了一大堆叶子  -听我说  厄尼
- We've landed a load of sticky bush. - Listen to me, now, Ernie.

39:36.180 --> 39:37.240
赶紧走
Walk away.

39:37.740 --> 39:39.650
太晚了  我们已经在拳馆卸货了
It's too late. We're at the gym now unloading the van.

39:39.650 --> 39:40.830
你把我的车开去了
You took my van?

39:41.660 --> 39:43.760
在那等着  我十分钟内到
Wait there. I'll be back in ten minutes.

39:44.470 --> 39:47.710

41:48.070 --> 41:49.380
我是哪根筋搭错了
What was I thinking,

41:49.420 --> 41:51.920
把你们这帮兔崽子留在这没人看着
leaving you kids alone unsupervised?

41:53.120 --> 41:55.550
给我撤下来  马上
Take it down. Now!

41:55.550 --> 41:57.630
不得不说  出乎我的意料
I've gotta say, I was impressed.

41:57.970 --> 42:00.930
他们打架的仗势  一看就是练过的

谢谢  够了
Thank you. That's enough.

42:05.270 --> 42:07.340

- Well, I'm just saying. - Well, quit saying.

42:07.340 --> 42:08.690
好吧  谢谢
Okay, thank you.

42:09.460 --> 42:12.510
我刚接受了马修的收购报价
No sooner do I entertain Matthew's offer to buy me out

42:12.510 --> 42:14.740
拒绝了干眼
and reject Dry Eye's offer

42:15.270 --> 42:17.040
我的一个农场就被人抢了
does one of my farms get raided.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.280
前所未有
First time ever.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.130
怎么看也不像是巧合  对吧
Doesn't feel like a coincidence, does it?

42:20.130 --> 42:22.720
肯定不是  这就是计划好的
It isn't. There's fuckery afoot.

42:23.130 --> 42:25.570
-他们怎么找到农场的  -不清楚
- How did they find it? - I don't know.

42:25.570 --> 42:27.090
我调查一下
I'm making inquiries.

42:28.090 --> 42:29.490
马修那边怎么样
What about Matthew?

42:29.820 --> 42:33.040
他得有十足的把握才会交出这四亿
He's gonna need reassuring before he parts with 400 big ones.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.990
还有很多疑点  雷
So many questions unanswered, Ray.

42:34.990 --> 42:38.930
比如  是谁这么聪明  找到了迈奇的农场
I mean, who'd be smart enough to find one of Mickey's farms?

42:39.030 --> 42:40.570
当然  除我之外
Apart from me, of course.

42:40.910 --> 42:44.920
再比如  谁有这么大胆子这么干
And who would be bold enough to make such a move?

42:44.920 --> 42:47.990
还全程录像  发布到网上
Especially to film it all and then post it all online?

42:47.990 --> 42:51.900
因为这样做分明就是当众打你的脸  不是吗
Because that is really rubbing your face in it, isn't it?

42:52.370 --> 42:53.800
我是来帮忙的  迈克尔
I'm here to help, Michael.

42:53.800 --> 42:56.200
我是你的朋友  你的盟友
I'm your friend, your ally,

42:56.200 --> 42:58.230
你的全年无休圣诞老人
your Santa Claus for all seasons,

42:58.380 --> 43:02.430
希望你知道我的精灵团队非常有说服力
and I'd like you to know my team of elves can be very persuasive.

43:02.570 --> 43:06.500
说服力  我要说服力干什么
Persuasive? And why would I need persuasive?

43:06.500 --> 43:10.080
我听说你遇到了一点小麻烦
Well, I hear you might have had a little trouble.

43:10.590 --> 43:12.820
之前我没有资源时你帮过我一把
Now, you helped me before when my source ran dry,

43:12.820 --> 43:15.340
所以我也还你个人情  给你提个醒
so I'm just returning the favor and reminding you

43:15.340 --> 43:17.120
我有一些可靠的朋友
I have effectual friends.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.110
精灵吗
Elves?

43:19.180 --> 43:20.190
什么精灵
Elves?

43:20.260 --> 43:23.340
-你自己说的精灵  -我说了吗
- Yes. You said elves. - Did I?

43:25.090 --> 43:28.650
我没意见  马修  完全没有
No trouble over here, Matthew. No trouble at all.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.050
我给你带了个小礼物
So we brought you a token.

43:33.050 --> 43:34.100
真的吗
You did?

43:35.980 --> 43:39.830
是个什么礼物呢
And what might this be?

43:39.830 --> 43:42.190
是个镇纸  你可以用来压好
It's a paperweight to keep down all the paper

43:42.190 --> 43:43.420
我要给你的文件
I'm about to give you.

43:43.420 --> 43:46.400
-我看像把枪  -也是个镇纸
- Well, it looks like a gun. - And it's a paperweight.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.640
但是在这个国家
Seeing how in this country,

43:47.640 --> 43:50.510
跟在我的祖国不同  枪是非法的
unlike in our homeland, they're illegal.

43:50.520 --> 43:53.360
晚上骑自行车不开车灯也违法
So is riding your bicycle at night without lights.

43:53.390 --> 43:55.060
法律只是起个指引作用
Laws are there as a guideline.

43:55.060 --> 43:57.790
在法国  给猪起名叫拿破仑是违法的
In France, it's illegal to call a pig Napoleon,

43:57.790 --> 43:59.390
但我就要这么做  来抓我呀
but just try and stop me.

44:01.270 --> 44:03.480
我很喜欢  你们很贴心
I quite like it. You're very kind.

44:03.590 --> 44:06.240
-谢谢  -两岸一家亲
- Thank you. - Hands across the sea.

44:06.480 --> 44:08.160
迈奇打消了犹太人的疑虑
Mickey calmed down the Jew

44:08.160 --> 44:10.510
看起来交易仍然会如期进行
and it seems the deal is still going ahead.

44:10.510 --> 44:14.030
但时机不佳  威胁到了交易  农场也关了
But bad timing, jeopardizing deals, shutting down farms.

44:12.580 --> 44:16.430
亨利勋爵
二号庄园

44:14.030 --> 44:15.940
如果迈奇不收拾干净残局
It could be an expensive disaster

44:15.940 --> 44:18.140
就会损失惨重
if Mickey doesn't get this cleaned up.

44:18.620 --> 44:20.530
我应该害怕吗
Should I be scared?

44:21.710 --> 44:25.470
我看不必  但我觉得还是应该小心为上
I don't think so, but I like to err on the side of caution.

44:25.570 --> 44:26.940
什么意思
What does that mean?

44:27.030 --> 44:29.280
意思就是我得歇业
It means I'm going to have to close shop,

44:29.290 --> 44:32.160
关闭农场  让它彻底消失
shut this farm down and make it disappear.

44:32.590 --> 44:34.210
你这几天可能会看见
You might see a couple of trucks around here

44:34.210 --> 44:36.370
这里有几辆车进出  但仅此而已
over the next few days, but that's it.

44:36.490 --> 44:37.590
我不会装作
Well, I'm not gonna pretend that

44:37.590 --> 44:39.850
每年少了一百万英镑的佣金
missing out on a million pounds commission a year

44:39.850 --> 44:41.190
对我来说不算什么
isn't going to hurt somewhat.

44:41.190 --> 44:43.070
不是只有你有损失
The pain is being shared.

44:43.190 --> 44:46.660
被盗的货品  由此产生的收入
Stolen product, loss of earnings meantime,

44:46.660 --> 44:50.070
关闭农场的花费  在其它地方重头再来的开销
the cost of shutting down, the expense of setting up elsewhere.

44:50.490 --> 44:52.690
有意思  但时机真是再糟不过了
It's funny, really, but it couldn't be worse timing.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.070
怎么说
How so?

44:54.300 --> 44:55.700
我刚...
I've...

44:56.540 --> 44:59.120
我刚发现我们需要修新的屋顶
I've just learned we need a whole new roof apparently.

44:59.120 --> 45:02.470
正如我所说  我和你一样为这事感到心烦
As I say, I'm as upset about this as you are.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.180
-亨利  -迈奇
- Henry. - Mickey.

45:09.760 --> 45:11.480
平时迈奇靠贵族公子照拂
The toffs look after Mickey.

45:11.480 --> 45:13.850
现在轮到迈奇照顾他们了
Now Mickey looks after the toffs.

45:14.110 --> 45:16.970
但需要照顾的贵族公子有很多
But there's a lot of toffs to look after.

45:17.510 --> 45:19.680
-亨利  -屋漏...
- Henry. - And when it rains...

45:19.680 --> 45:21.420
让我来处理屋顶的事吧
Let me take care of the roof.

45:21.420 --> 45:23.590
偏逢连夜雨
it fucking pours.

45:23.980 --> 45:25.380
现在只有一件事
Now, there's only one thing

45:25.380 --> 45:27.580
比贵族公子更需要照顾
that needs more looking after than a toff,

45:27.140 --> 45:31.650
普雷斯菲尔德勋爵
十二号庄园

45:27.580 --> 45:29.710
那就是贵族公子的子孙
and that is a toff's offspring.

45:29.710 --> 45:33.160
正好让我继续回到大戴夫的故事
Which brings me neatly back to Big Dave's story,

45:33.160 --> 45:35.910
这也是我为什么来这里
the very reason I'm sitting here sipping whiskey with you

45:35.910 --> 45:37.550
跟你小酌威士忌的原因
in the first fucking place.

45:37.550 --> 45:41.280
大戴夫就是这样扳倒迈奇的
This is how Big Dave is gonna bring Mickey down,

45:41.280 --> 45:45.710
利用并伤害普雷斯菲尔德勋爵深爱的女儿
by using and abusing Lord Pressfield's much-beloved child.

45:45.710 --> 45:47.360
普雷斯菲尔德勋爵的女儿
Lord Pressfield's daughter,

45:47.360 --> 45:49.110
赫赫有名  才华横溢的劳拉
the famous and talented Laura,

45:49.110 --> 45:50.510
仇恨自我  伤害自己
all self-hate and harm,

45:50.510 --> 45:54.160
深陷瘾君子鲍尔·诺埃尔的阴郁魅力
has fallen for this Power Noel's smacked-out dark charm,

45:54.160 --> 45:55.910
这种故事多多益善
and I want the lot of them,

45:56.300 --> 45:59.280
尤其是那种  谄媚的小娘们皮尔森
especially that slimy little jam rag Pearson,

45:59.280 --> 46:01.970
和一个名声败坏的穷光蛋贵族公子同床共枕
in bed with a skint, discredited toff,

46:01.970 --> 46:05.560
还向那些父母忙着在瑞士阿尔卑斯山滑雪
and supplying gear to young and reckless rock-star royals,

46:05.560 --> 46:08.090
且愚不可及对儿女不闻不问的
royals unbridled by distracted parents

46:08.090 --> 46:10.280
叛逆年轻皇室子弟
too busy skiing on the Swiss Alps to notice

46:10.280 --> 46:12.760
供应兴奋剂
and too fucking stupid to care.

46:12.800 --> 46:14.740
我喜欢  你很擅长这个  老大
I like it. You're good at this, boss.

46:14.740 --> 46:17.400
我当然知道我擅长什么  哈米  闭嘴
Yeah, I know what I'm good at, Hammy. Fuck off.

46:17.750 --> 46:19.650
出身名门  吸毒成瘾
Aristocratic, junkie,

46:19.660 --> 46:22.630
暴饮暴食  唱歌需要调音的千金大小姐
bulimic, auto-tuned singing daughter

46:21.300 --> 46:26.980
美国骗子
出身名门  吸毒成瘾
暴饮暴食  唱歌需要调音的千金大小姐

46:22.630 --> 46:25.380
和一个昙花一现的流行歌手同过居
shacked up with some smacked-out, once-upon-a-time pop star,

46:25.380 --> 46:27.130
全由迈奇·皮尔森照顾
and all looked after by Mickey Pearson.

46:27.130 --> 46:30.480
我喜欢  我很喜欢
I like it. You know, I like it a lot.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.640
我们把她宠坏了
We wrapped her in cotton wool.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.740
但她可是我们的小罗拉
But she was our little Lor-la.

46:36.080 --> 46:39.600
查理这么喊她是因为以前她不会念劳拉
Charlie called her that because she couldn't say Laura at first.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.630
我们很想她  迈奇
We miss her terribly, Mickey.

46:42.480 --> 46:44.500
我这爸当的真失败
I've failed as a parent.

46:44.500 --> 46:46.540
你也不要过于自责了  亲爱的
You mustn't keep beating yourself up, dear.

46:46.540 --> 46:49.410
安妮说得对  查尔斯  不要自责了
Anne's right, Charles. You mustn't blame yourselves.

46:49.410 --> 46:51.590
听起来劳拉是在很脆弱的时期
It sounds as though Laura fell in with the wrong crowd

46:51.590 --> 46:54.250
结交了一群不该结交的朋友
at a time when she was particularly vulnerable.

46:54.250 --> 46:56.040
我们还能做点什么呢
What more could we do?

46:56.900 --> 46:59.020
我们很多朋友的孩子都是这样
It's happened to so many of our friends.

46:59.020 --> 47:00.530
这就是个诅咒
It's a curse.

47:01.530 --> 47:04.400
-我能调查一下这事吗  -你会帮我们吗
- Do you mind if I look into it? - So you'll help us?

47:05.640 --> 47:07.240
我看看我能帮上什么忙
Let me see what I can do.

47:11.640 --> 47:13.730
你也该给自己整一套  老大
You should get yourself one of these, boss.

47:13.730 --> 47:15.450
我也是这么想的
Well, that's the plan.

47:15.530 --> 47:17.080
一切都好吗
Everything all right?

47:17.490 --> 47:18.860
你还记得他们的女儿吗
You remember their daughter?

47:18.860 --> 47:21.030
记得  劳拉  好姑娘  有副好嗓子
Yeah, Laura. Nice girl. Good voice.

47:21.030 --> 47:24.680
一个叛逆的小摇滚乐手  可惜了好这一口
Teeny sort of spunk-funk fuck pop. Shame about the habit.

47:24.680 --> 47:28.230
她失踪了  父母让我们帮忙找到她  送她回家
She's gone missing. They've asked us to find her, bring her home.

47:30.700 --> 47:31.590
有什么问题吗
Is that a problem?

47:31.590 --> 47:33.600
我猜到你会要我这么做了  老大
Well, I had a feeling you might ask me this, boss,

47:33.600 --> 47:35.300
所以我提前调查了一番
so I did some due diligence.

47:35.300 --> 47:37.160
查到她在哪了  那地方很不妙
I know where she is and I don't like it.

47:37.160 --> 47:39.690
-我们最好不要插手这事  -为什么
- I'd rather we didn't get involved. - Why not?

47:39.900 --> 47:41.990
她在伦敦南部的市建住宅里
She's on a South London council estate.

47:41.990 --> 47:44.580
-那又怎么样  -不是我们的地盘
- So? - It's out of our jurisdiction.

47:44.820 --> 47:47.030
有许多不确定因素  我们没有十足的把握
There's too many moving parts, parts that we can't control.

47:47.030 --> 47:49.040
如果她不愿意回家怎么办  场面会变得很难看
What if she doesn't wanna come? It's gonna get messy.

47:49.040 --> 47:52.100
或许你说得对  但你还是得去
Well, that may be true, but you're still doing it.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.300
我理解
I accept that.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.700
但能不能让弗莱泽尔去办这事
But can't you send Frazier instead?

47:56.700 --> 47:58.640
不  我不能让弗莱泽尔去
No, I can't send Frazier instead.

47:58.640 --> 48:00.510
你是我最得力的手下  我要你去
You're my best man. I want you.

48:06.460 --> 48:08.070
我不喜欢瘾君子
It's just that I don't like smackies.

48:08.070 --> 48:09.990
他们就像浴缸里的肮脏污秽和蛆虫一样
It's the filth and the grime and the grub in the tub.

48:09.990 --> 48:13.690
我又没让你这个强迫症去跟他们欢度周末  雷
I'm not asking your OCD to spend the weekend with them, Ray.

48:14.480 --> 48:16.420
就当是做慈善了
Think of it as philanthropy.

48:17.570 --> 48:19.090
走吧  你开车
Come on, you're driving.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.800
好心没好报
No good deed goes unpunished.

48:23.390 --> 48:26.790
这时候就轮到你表演了  对吧  雷蒙德
And this is where you have your moment, isn't it, Raymondo?

48:26.790 --> 48:28.520
该你闪亮登场
This is where you step on stage

48:28.520 --> 48:31.530
推动多米诺骨牌一枚枚倒下
and set the dominoes flying every-fucking-where.

48:32.350 --> 48:33.480
什么意思
Meaning what?

48:33.480 --> 48:37.280
意思是"好心没好报"
Meaning no good deed goes unpunished.

48:37.480 --> 48:39.540
叩  叩叩  叩  叩
Knock, knock-knock, knock, knock.

48:47.980 --> 48:49.720
早上好
Buenos dias.

48:50.070 --> 48:51.500
你走错了
Wrong door.

48:53.690 --> 48:57.250
我是雷蒙德·史密斯
My name is Raymond Smith.

48:58.020 --> 49:00.600
我能进屋谈谈吗
Can I step inside for a moment, please?

49:06.850 --> 49:08.720
有什么事吗  警官
How can I help you, Officer?

49:09.250 --> 49:12.630
我不是警察  只是需要占用你一点时间
I'm not the police. No, I just need a moment of your time.

49:12.630 --> 49:14.910
谈谈劳拉·普雷斯菲尔德
It's about Laura Pressfield.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.710
没听说过这个名字
I don't know anyone of that name.

49:18.310 --> 49:20.790
如果你能让我进屋谈谈的话
It would be much easier for all parties concerned

49:20.790 --> 49:23.150
对所有人都更轻松
if I could just step inside for a moment.

49:23.470 --> 49:25.060
不行  快滚
No, fuck off.

49:25.320 --> 49:26.900
妈呀
Jeez.

这车真不错啊  老兄
That's a nice whip, bruv.

49:29.220 --> 49:31.460
发动机超赞  就是轮毂不太行
Killer motor. It's a shame about them rims, though.

49:31.460 --> 49:32.910
借我们开开呗
Yeah, lend us the keys.

49:32.910 --> 49:34.490
改装成镀铬二十二英寸轮毂玩玩
Put some chrome twenty-twos on that.

这老哥穿着踝靴和喇叭裤呢
Hey, my man's got the Dessies and the bootcuts, you know.

49:37.400 --> 49:39.350
怕不是个娘娘腔吧
Deffo linking a jessie.

49:54.460 --> 49:55.780
搞什么
What the fuck?

50:00.840 --> 50:03.000
-你们进来干什么  -别激动
- What are you doing here? - Now, now, now.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.010
-快滚出去  -稳住  稳住

乖乖坐好
Sit down.

Who the fuck are your mates, Brown?

50:46.720 --> 50:48.810
没有必要激动  年轻人
No need to get excited, young man.

50:48.810 --> 50:50.910

We will be gone in a few moments.

50:50.910 --> 50:53.770
不不不  你们现在就得离开  赶快滚出去
No, no, no, you'll be gone before then. Get the fuck out now.

50:56.530 --> 50:58.880
老虎不发威当我是病猫吗  赶快滚
I can be dangerous if I want to be. Get the fuck out now.

50:58.880 --> 51:02.800
坐下  鲍尔  我劝你在惹上麻烦之前回去坐好
Sit down, Power, before you get yourself into more trouble.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.340
你怎么知道我的名字  他怎么会知道我的名字

51:59.670 --> 52:01.350
我猜也是
Sounds about right.

52:01.710 --> 52:04.090
你说的没错  他是个自大狂
Well, you are correct. He is a big dick swinger.

52:04.090 --> 52:06.070
但这话最好别当他的面说
But I wouldn't want him to hear you say that.

52:06.070 --> 52:07.080
最好在我们分别之后
It's best you forget

52:07.080 --> 52:10.040
你就能忘记他是干什么的
what he apparently does for a living after we depart.

52:10.810 --> 52:14.430
劳拉  你父亲委托我们带你回家
Now, Laura, your father's asked us to bring you home.

52:14.430 --> 52:16.130

我卷大麻时不用美国人那种新潮方法
I don't build a joint like the Americans and the new school...

52:43.370 --> 52:45.270

back-strapping, jockstrapping,

52:45.270 --> 52:47.620
什么混可卡因卷  都是扯淡
coke-wrapping, and all that bollocks.

我喜欢经典的一半大麻一半烟叶
I like a good old-fashioned 50-50 mix, me.

如果说有什么毒品是绝不能沾的
If there's one drug you should not chase,

53:01.100 --> 53:02.350

你试过白粉吗  巴尼
Did you ever give it a spin, Bunny?

53:04.270 --> 53:07.240
我没碰过  雷  我连大麻戒了
No, not me, Ray. I don't even puff anymore.

53:07.240 --> 53:11.560
那是当然  巴尼喜欢健身  你们也看得出来
Of course not. Bunny likes the gym. You can probably see that.

我怎么了  我能举多重吗
What about me? What could I lift?

53:21.560 --> 53:24.460
你连块奶酪都举不起来  傻逼
You couldn't lift a wheel of cheese, you cunt.

53:27.620 --> 53:28.930
好了
Now...

53:31.030 --> 53:32.790
如果你们想玩点刺激的
if you wanna be naughty,

53:32.810 --> 53:36.060
不如抽着大麻做着爱喝着酒
what happened to a little smoke and a poke and a glass of wine,

53:36.070 --> 53:38.530
听着巴里·怀特  享受着烛光鸳鸯浴

53:48.940 --> 53:51.660
还有巴里·怀特在伺候我的小女友吗
Barry White's finger in my missus?

53:51.860 --> 53:56.110
闭嘴吧布朗  我讲到巴里·怀特之前你就已经懵了
Be quiet, Brown. You were lost long before Barry White walked in.

54:07.780 --> 54:09.670
如果你们不开心的话
If you lot are unhappy,

54:09.910 --> 54:12.650
应该找朋友倾诉一下思绪

找正经朋友  把心事讲出来  用积极的态度面对
Nice friends. Talk it out, find a positive solution.

沉浸在自己的白人愧疚感中
Drowning in your liberal white guilt.

54:25.560 --> 54:27.500
不好意思  我为什么愧疚
Sorry, what am I guilty of?

54:27.500 --> 54:29.630
因为你是个傻逼  布朗
Being a cunt, Brown.

54:30.830 --> 54:32.440
你个傻逼
Being a cunt.

54:33.870 --> 54:35.480
话说回来  我又不是你们的心理医生
Anyway, I'm not your shrink.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.380
我只是试着给你们分享一些正能量
I'm just trying to radiate some positive vibes man to man.

54:38.380 --> 54:41.040
毕竟搞大麻曾经是件积极向上的事
I mean, that's what this puff game used to be all about.

54:44.200 --> 54:45.680
扯远了
Anyway...

54:47.850 --> 54:49.420
轮到你表态了  劳拉

试试给你爸爸妈妈省省心
Do your mum and dad a favor and try the impossible,

让自己开心起来
make yourself happy.

Fucking hell. That was easy.

这破地方我也不愿意待了
It's a shithole anyway.

55:41.490 --> 55:43.290
求求你别走  等一下
Don't go. Please, wait!

55:45.830 --> 55:47.290

再敢碰我  我就把你胳膊卸了
Touch me again, I'll cut your fucking arm off.

I just will not be manhandled by a junkie cunt.

56:06.360 --> 56:11.030
戴夫  让孩子们老老实实待一分钟
Dave, keep the kids in school for one minute.

56:15.160 --> 56:17.220

My man probably wants to buy weed.

56:17.260 --> 56:20.390
-想要"浓药"吗  -还是"紫烟"

56:20.390 --> 56:22.940
我哥们刚抽了一记"呛死驴"
My man just pulled out a donkey choker, bruv.

56:22.940 --> 56:24.460

Keep your puff.

给自己去买个便签本  再买包糖
Buy yourself a sticky book and a packet of sweets.

56:28.730 --> 56:30.260
太阔了
All-in!

56:31.050 --> 56:32.690
别动  别动
Now, now, now.

56:34.530 --> 56:36.080
你个傻逼
You cunt.

56:36.490 --> 56:38.040
去你妈的
Fuck you!

56:38.310 --> 56:41.070

Fucking hit him, Brown!

56:52.460 --> 56:55.220
他送了你一把枪
Ah. He's bought you a gun.

56:55.220 --> 56:57.250
这小礼物不错
That's a nice little gift.

56:57.300 --> 56:59.830
这个小礼物就能让你蹲五年牢
Five years in prison all in one little box.

56:59.830 --> 57:02.730
这可不是枪  亲爱的  这是个镇纸
Oh, but that's not a gun, dear. That's a paperweight.

57:02.730 --> 57:07.090
当然当然  还配了六颗可爱的小子弹
Course it is, along with a family of six baby bullets.

57:08.110 --> 57:09.930
得抓紧把这东西处理掉
Guess we'll have to get rid of that.

57:10.670 --> 57:12.920
-你好  雷  -罗莎兰

Sorry for the interruption.

57:14.350 --> 57:15.860

What do you need, Ray?

57:15.880 --> 57:19.040
劳拉·普雷斯菲尔德已经安全回家了

57:25.170 --> 57:26.450

还有什么
What else?

57:31.150 --> 57:33.450
她的一个小同伴出了点小意外
One of her associates had an accident.

57:34.460 --> 57:37.070

57:37.070 --> 57:38.480
老狼老狼几点钟
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

57:38.480 --> 57:42.730
到了该你们滚蛋的钟点了
It's time for you to fuck off, lads.

57:44.710 --> 57:45.740
哎我操
Oh, shit.

57:45.740 --> 57:47.400
听起来是个很悲惨的意外
Sounds like quite an extreme accident.

57:47.400 --> 57:50.170
是的  更确切地说是死了
Yeah, it was more like a death, really.

57:51.200 --> 57:53.440
-哎我操  -来个自拍  兄弟
- Oh, shit. - Selfie, bruv!

57:53.440 --> 57:55.010
所以你杀人了
So you killed someone?

57:55.150 --> 57:57.510
不  是地心引力杀掉了他
No. It was the gravity that killed him.

57:58.130 --> 58:00.070
-他是什么人  -阿斯兰
- Who was he? - Aslan.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.260
是个爱吸毒的俄罗斯小孩
Some Russian kid with tracks on his arms.

58:02.260 --> 58:04.670
俄罗斯  那可不妙
Russian kid? That doesn't sound good.

58:04.670 --> 58:05.450
有人看到这事吗
Anyone see you?

58:05.450 --> 58:07.360
来张自拍  快拍一张
Little selfie? Selfie, bruv?

58:07.360 --> 58:08.310
妈的
Shit.

58:08.310 --> 58:11.070
没有留下证据  我们已经清理干净了
Nothing was recorded. We left it clean.

58:11.070 --> 58:13.680
-尸体呢  -我处理掉了
- The body? - I've dealt with that.

58:15.170 --> 58:18.070
-这可不是好事  -确实
- This is not ideal. - It is not.

58:18.240 --> 58:21.180
别看那些小子穿得破破烂烂
You can't be fooled by how those junkies dress.

58:21.390 --> 58:24.680
-他们都是上贵族学校的  -阿斯兰
- They went to schools, expensive schools. - Aslan.

58:24.680 --> 58:27.540
他们的父母很有钱  非常有钱
Their parents have money, lots of money.

58:28.590 --> 58:30.550
而钱会带来麻烦
And money can be a problem.

58:32.300 --> 58:33.250
见鬼
Shit.

58:33.250 --> 58:36.840
我猜你没告诉迈奇真相
I bet you told Mickey nothing about what happened.

58:36.920 --> 58:40.200
你是在套我的话  弗莱彻  因为你一无所知
You're fishing, Fletcher, because you've got no idea.

58:40.200 --> 58:43.100
你说得对  我在套话
You're right, I am fishing.

58:43.100 --> 58:47.480
看  我要在我的包里摸索一番
Look at this. I'm fishing in my little baggie.

58:47.930 --> 58:49.830
看我找到了什么
And what have I found?

58:52.510 --> 58:55.040
谢谢  或者我该
Thank you. Or should I say...

58:55.640 --> 58:57.330
用俄语说谢谢
spasibo?

58:57.330 --> 58:58.600
那个年轻人在做什么呢
What's that young man doing?

58:58.600 --> 59:00.840
他是在地上找什么东西吗
Is he looking for something on the floor?

59:00.990 --> 59:02.780
弗莱泽尔
Frazier.

59:03.030 --> 59:05.980
伙计们  你们得把手机给我们
Lads, we're gonna need those phones.

59:06.270 --> 59:08.110
跑  快跑  兄弟  快跑
Hey, run. Move, bruv. Move.

59:08.110 --> 59:10.750
巴尼  抓住他  清理现场
Bunny, get him. Fucking clean that up.

59:10.950 --> 59:13.850
-来啊  抓我啊  混蛋  -小王八蛋
- Come on then, catch me, dickhead. - Little cunt.

59:37.870 --> 59:39.290
废物
Wanker!

59:44.320 --> 59:47.570
傻眼了吧  现在我有兄弟撑腰了
What you saying now, fam? Huh? Now I've got backup.

59:48.850 --> 59:51.280
那你也没法给手机备份  傻逼
You couldn't back up a phone, you cunt.

59:51.770 --> 59:53.400
兄弟  这家伙想抢我手机
Bruv, this guy's trying to take my phone.

59:53.400 --> 59:55.710
-干他的  -滚
- Fucking do him. - Back the fuck up!

59:55.710 --> 59:57.360
你想怎么巧言脱身啊  兄弟
How you gonna talk your way out of this one, mate?

59:57.360 --> 59:59.100
别紧张  伙计们
Easy, lads.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:03.910
你们肯定都是道上的人  混黑帮的
I'm sure you're all roadmen, gangsters,

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:07.320
都是些恶棍阿飞
proper naughty boys and all that bollocks.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.150
但我不想找事
But I come in peace.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.940
我没想偷  我是想买下它
I'm not trying to steal it. I'm trying to buy it.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.660
用真金白银买
For good money. Honest money.

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:22.920
是吗  买这个手机
Yeah? What, this phone?

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:27.910
-多少钱  -一千块
- How much? - A full bag.

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:32.350
然后我就会消失  就像黎明时刻的黑暗一样
Then I'll be gone, like the darkness at dawn.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.220
你不如直接把钱给我们  然后滚蛋
How about you give us that bag and be gone anyway?

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:45.570
别胡闹了  傻逼
Stop fucking around, cunt.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:51.710
钱拿走  把手机给我
Give me the phone and take the money.

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:54.630
把钱放下赶紧滚  小子
Drop the fucking money and run, boy.

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:02.910
行
Right.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.370
-见鬼  -跑  跑  跑
- Fuck! - Move, move, move!

01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:10.460
现在
Now...

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:16.400
把手机放在地上
put the phone on the ground.

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:41.090
-可恶的小鬼  -你在做什么  戴夫
- Fucking prick. - What are you doing, Dave?

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.260
手机就在他身上
It's on him somewhere.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.760
我在找了  等一下  见鬼
I'm trying. Just give me a second. Fuck.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.160
雷
Ray?

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.880
我能用下你的卫生间吗  就尿个尿
Can I use your toilet? Just a pee-pee?

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:55.950
弗莱彻  进屋脱鞋
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.660
把鞋子留在门边
Leave them by the door.

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:59.140
是  妈妈
Yes, Mommy.

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.540
来啊  兄弟  你的速度呢  兄弟
Come on, bruv. Where's your pace, brother?

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.260
你还能再跑快点
You can do better than that.

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:06.860
废物
Wanker.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.730
快点  巴尼  别浪费时间了
Come on, Bunny, stop fucking about.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.970
看看你出汗出的  兄弟
Look at you sweat, bruv.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.200
差一点  差一点  差一点
Nearly there. Nearly there. Nearly there.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.750
把腿抬起来啊  加油  兄弟
Lift those legs up. Come on, bro.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.480
你今天应该穿跑鞋出门的  兄弟
You should have brought your running shoes today, bro.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.170
为参加奥运会练练腿脚
Trying out for the Olympics, are we?

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.880
这是飞人博尔特  加油啊  飞人
It's fucking Usain Bolt. Come on, Usain.

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:38.010
手机
Phone.

01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:48.200
抱歉
Sorry about that.

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:52.110
我现在能回家了吗
Can I go home now?

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:55.160
当然可以  亲爱的  当然
Course you can, darling. Course you can.

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.400
有问题吗  雷
Is there a problem here, Ray?

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.830
我不知道
I don't know.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.620
有问题吗  弗莱彻
Is there a problem here, Fletcher?

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:24.010
完全没有
I see no problem at all.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.750
我忘记洗手了
I forgot to wash my hands.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.870
下次来先打声招呼
Next time call first.

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:32.390
抱歉  兄弟
Sorry, guv.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.190
你没有听见一点风声
And you haven't heard a whisper?

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:37.930
丢了这么多叶子  怎么会没有一点消息
How can so much bush go missing and nobody know nothing?

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:40.120
说实话我什么都没听说  教练
Ah, I've heard nothing, Coach, honestly.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.170
街上没什么风声  但你知道吗
Nothing on the street. But you know what?

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:44.170
有个叫迈奇·皮尔森的老头
There is this geezer called Mickey Pearson.

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:46.310
-迈奇·皮尔森是谁  -你知道他的
- Who the fuck is Mickey Pearson? - Ah, you know him.

01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:48.590
他是做叶子生意的  一个狠角色
He runs the bush game. He's a horrible cunt.

01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:50.220
最好别招惹他
You don't wanna step on his toes.

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.780
但你的人不可能去撬他的车
But there's no way your lads jimmied their way into his car,

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.550
所以你不用担心这个问题
so I wouldn't concern yourself with that.

01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:56.240
好  你知道去哪里找我  查撒
All right, you know where to find me, Chasa.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.710
帮我留意消息
Keep your ear to the ground.

01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:59.670
大主角  你进去
Primetime, in you get.

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.390
厄尼
Ernie.

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:05.020
你知道那个中国人叫什么了吗
Did you get that Chinese fella's name?

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.180
-茨奥[福]  -什么
- Phuc. - What?

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.080
茨奥  和"操"很像  但是"茨"开头
Phuc, like "Fuck" With a "Ph."

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.820
别跟我来道上那套  厄尼  他住在哪里
Don't get street with me, Ernie. Where does he live?

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.760
-克罗伊登的富人区  -把绳子放下
- Posh part of Croydon. - Drop the rope.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.770
克罗伊登没有富人区
There is no posh part of Croydon.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.730
-相对而言  好吗  -厄尼  你在做什么
- It's comparative, innit? - Oi, Ernie, what are you doing?

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.760
你为什么不来训练  你这黑贱人
Why aren't you training, you black cunt?

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.530
这就我一个人
I'm on my own here.

01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:25.940
他是不是刚叫我黑贱人
Did he just call me a black cunt?

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.660
-是的  -他不能那么说  那是种族歧视
- Yes, he did. - He can't do that. That's racist.

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.510
但你是黑人  也是贱人  厄尼
But, you are black and you are a cunt, Ernie.

01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:31.510
这是事实
Those are the facts.

01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:33.910
我觉得大主角不关心你的种族
I don't think Primetime cares what race you run in.

01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:35.250
我是黑人
The fact that I'm black

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:36.920
和我是不是贱人没关系
has nothing to do with the fact I'm a cunt.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.620
他没说黑人是贱人  厄尼
He didn't say black people were cunts, Ernie.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:39.760
他只是说你
He was being specific to you.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.190
二者之间毫无关联
One has nothing to do with the other.

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:42.970
并且更进一步而言  如果我没搞错的话
And I'd go a step further, if I'm not mistaken,

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:45.000
这么叫你一种亲昵的表现
and say it was a term of familiar affection.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.150
大主角是吉普赛人
Primetime's a Gypsy.

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:47.820
但我不会叫他吉普赛贱人
I wouldn't call him a pikey cunt.

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:49.900
干嘛不叫  也许他不介意
Why not? He might be very understanding.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.520
当然  必须是出于朋友之情
Only if it comes from a place of love, of course.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.290
现在说回眼前这件事
Now, back to the issue at hand.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:55.980
我需要那个中国人的地址  好吗
I need that Chinese geezer's address, okay?

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.430
明早给你  教练
You'll have it by the morning, coach.

01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:59.120
-好伙计  -还有  教练...
- Good lad. - And, coach...

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.650
-什么  -我有个好消息
- What? - I've got some good news.

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:03.610
-什么  -我知道我们拿了谁的大麻了
- What? - I found out whose weed we took.

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:07.370
操你妈的现在才说
And now you fucking tell me!

01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:09.750
我让你们停了吗
Did I say stop?

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.930
厄尼  这不是
Ernie, this is not the fucking time

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:16.230
藏着掖着的时候了
to keep your cards close to your chest.

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:19.090
告诉我他的名字不是迈奇·皮尔森
Just tell me his name isn't Mickey Pearson.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.350
天呐  教练  你也是吉普赛人吗
Blimey, coach, are you a Gypsy too?

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.360
你用茶叶渣和水晶球占卜出来了吗
You been reading tea leaves, got a crystal ball?

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.110
这可不是好消息  厄尼
That is not good news, Ernie.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.730
背上巨大的暴力人情
Mickey Pearson is terrible news

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:28.970
迈奇·皮尔森绝不是好消息
in the face of a violent and expensive debt.

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.930
我是来见你的老大的
I'm here to see your boss.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.380
有什么话就说吧
Feel free to talk.

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:50.870
我那些蠢孩子们去你们地盘闹了事
I gather you're the consigliere of the outfit

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:53.880
我猜你就是这个组织的顾问吧
that my boys were stupid enough to fuck around with.

01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:58.620
我想代表他们为这件事道歉
On that note, I'd like to extend my apologies on their behalf.

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.240
我那些孩子  很天真
My boys, they're naive,

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.370
他们以前都过着苦日子  现在刚有点起色
they've had hard lives and they're just starting to come good,

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:06.590
但他们是我的人  这事是我的责任
but they're my lads, my responsibility,

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:09.230
所以应该由我为他们的行为负责
so it's me that should be accountable for their actions.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.540
我可以把你们的货物还给你们
Now, I can return your goods,

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:13.440
但我无法弥补他们给你们带来的不便
but I can't return the inconvenience,

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.580
浪费的时间  还有各种麻烦
the time, the fucking headache.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.240
所以我愿意向你们效忠
And so I offer you my loyalty,

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.540
做出承诺  奉献我的时间
my word, my time,

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:23.650
直到人情还清为止
until that debt is settled.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:30.010
我会作出补偿  但请放过我的人
I'll make amends, but just leave me lads alone.

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:34.150
首先  我要知道
First of all, I'm gonna need to know

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:35.820
你的人是怎么知道
how your lads got the information

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.680
我们农场的位置的
about where our farm was sited,

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.680
因为这不是人人都知道的事情
'cause that's not common knowledge.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:45.360
只有攻克了这一关  我们才能继续谈
Once we've overcome that little challenge, then we can talk.

01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:49.570
我的诚意不止如此
Well, I can do better than that.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:59.170
他的名字是茨奥  茨开头
His name is Phuc, but it's spelled with a "Ph,"

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.500
听起来像是操奥
so it sounds like "fu-uck."

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:03.670
是操奥吗
So it's Phu-uc?

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:06.180
什么  对  差不多吧
What? Yeah, something like that.

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.670
总之  农场的事是他搞出来的
Anyway, he's the kid that gave us the skunk farm job.

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.840
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:13.560
对  我们以前见过  是不是  操奥  茨奥
Yeah, we've met before, haven't we, Phu-uc... Phuc?

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.050
-是那个  -操奥吗
- That's the one. - Phu-uc?

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:16.390
-茨奥  -茨奥
- Phuc. - Phuc.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:18.930
好
All right.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.600
别做蠢事  好吗  小子
Don't do anything stupid, now, son, right?

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.310
你怎么知道地址的
How did you know the location?

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:27.560
我需要我的吸入器
I need my inhaler.

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:28.820
行啊  马上
Yeah, in a minute.

01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:33.280
你得告诉我你怎么知道我们农场的位置的
I need you to tell me how you knew the location of our farm.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:37.660
我跟踪你们好几个月了  干眼知道地址
I've been trailing you for months. Dry Eye was given the address.

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:41.620
我喘不上气  我需要吸入器  求你了
I can't breathe! I need it, please.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.080
行  茨奥  赶紧冷静下来
All right, Phuc. Calm the fu-uck down.

01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:49.420
好  给  镇定一点  我操
Right, here, steady yourself. For fuck's sake.

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:52.260
把他解开
Sort him out.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.090
好
All right.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.640
来  来  看着我
Here, here, look at me.

01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:59.730
-你还好吗  -还好
- You all right? - Yeah.

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.310
-你的吸入器呢  -在那里
- Where's your inhaler? - There.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.440
行  给  吸一口
Right, here, take a blim.

01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:08.770
好孩子  行了  小子  你还好吗
Now, good boy. There you go, son. You all right?

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:12.650
操
Fuck!

01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:15.280
不  停  不要
No, stop, don't!

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.000
见鬼  雷  你得去买点降落伞了
Fuck's sake, Ray. You need to invest in some parachutes.

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:27.960
我们要有新业务了
There's a pattern emerging here.

01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:29.210
抱歉  老大
I'm sorry, boss.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.630
这个掉下去的茨奥又是谁
And who's this jumping Phuc boy, anyway?

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.420
-是干眼的手下  -你是说乔治勋爵的手下
- It's Dry Eye's man. - You mean Lord George's man.

01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:38.610
可能是干眼擅自行动  他最近胆子很大
It could just be Dry Eye's doing. He's been getting bold lately.

01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:41.810
是  但他们还是乔治勋爵的人
Yeah. Well, they still all work for Lord George.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.850
这件事我要亲自处理
I'm gonna take care of this one myself.

01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:13.800
乔治勋爵
Lord George.

01:09:14.690 --> 01:09:15.880
皮尔森先生
Mr. Pearson.

01:09:17.610 --> 01:09:19.180
什么风把你吹来了
And to what do I owe?

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:31.730
你在看什么
What you watching?

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:34.690
我在看电视
I'm watching the telly.

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:36.650
你在看什么电视
What you watching on the telly?

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.530
看赛马
I'm watching the horse racing.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.410
香港直播
Live satellite from Hong Kong.

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:46.200
我唯一的罪行
My only vice.

01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:48.710
严格讲这不是真的  是吗
Well, that's not strictly true, is it?

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:50.080
什么意思
Meaning?

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:54.520
我一直将罪行定义为
Meaning I've always taken vice to be the definition

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.690
与卖淫  黄片或毒品有关的
of any criminal activity or wicked behavior

01:09:57.690 --> 01:10:00.560
邪恶的行为或犯罪行为
involving prostitution, pornography or drugs,

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.760
所以  不...
so, no...

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:07.100
赛马绝对不是你唯一的罪行  勋爵大人
racing is definitely not your only vice, your lordship.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.310
要我说  人类所有罪行  你都有所涉猎
I'd say you're eyebrows deep in every vice known to man.

01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:12.560
-不一样的  -什么不一样
- There is a difference. - Being?

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.290
我只协助  我不参与
I facilitate. I don't participate

01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:19.570
任何前述罪行
in any of the aforementioned vices.

01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:23.160
茶叶呢
What about tea?

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:35.000
茶叶怎么了
What about tea?

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.420
当然这也是罪行
Well, that too is a vice.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.510
咖啡因是一种毒品  你不知道吗
Caffeine is a drug, don't you know?

01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:45.180
你是来这里跟我谈这个的  茶叶
So is that what you're here to talk to me about? Tea?

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.140
如你所知  我选择涉足的罪行就是大麻
Sweet Mary Jane is my vice of choice, as you well know.

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:53.020
当然  我是说贩卖大麻  不是吸食
Of course, I'm addicted to selling it, not consuming it.

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:56.400
我特意选择了大麻交易
I specifically chose to deal in marijuana.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.870
当然  我知道做你选择的
Sure, I could see there was more to be made

01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:02.960
海洛因或者火药买卖更赚钱
in shifting the white or the brown powder, as you so chose,

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:07.200
但你看  我的大麻害不死人
but, you see, my jam, it doesn't kill anyone,

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.950
我喜欢这点
and I like that.

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:13.420
而你的毒药
While your poison...

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:19.380
从古至今一直在迫害世人
is and always has been a destroyer of worlds.

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:32.890
所以  没错  你所谓的协助和参与绝无二致
So, yes, your facilitation is most definitely participation.

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:45.950
但我不是来情境伦理说教的
But I'm not here to give you a sermon on situational ethics.

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.870
那你到底是来干什么的
So why the fuck are you here?

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.610
你是和我开战  乔治
You're starting a war with me, George,

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:10.440
我还想优雅地来个太空步
and I'm trying to moonwalk with elegance here,

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.810
但好像很难做到
but I'm finding it very fucking difficult.

01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.730
劳拉
Laura!

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:15.820
大麻生意我不开玩笑
I don't fuck around with puff.

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:18.030
你派手下干眼去找我
You send your man Dry Eye around my place

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.160
想试探能不能用点小钱买下我的生意
to see if he can buy my business for a few beans.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:20.820
劳拉
Laura!

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.360
你觉得我瞎吗
You didn't think I'd find out?

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.360
跟踪了我几个月我还察觉不到
Having me followed for months?

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:30.370
没错  你越界了
Yeah. You crossed the line,

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.490
所以你要为此付出代价
and that comes with a price.

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.000
你抢了我一个场子
You raided one of my locations.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.620
你懂规矩的  乔治
You know the rules, George.

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:40.180
你到底在想什么
What the fuck were you thinking?

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.930
你抢了我一个场子
You raided one of my locations.

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:43.800
你脑子进水了吗
What the fuck were you thinking?

01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:46.550
脑子进水了吗  乔治
What the fuck were you thinking, George?

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.550
你要是再敢在我地盘上搞破坏
Should you try and undermine me,

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.230
或是再企图威胁的我位子
or should you attempt to threaten my position again,

01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:32.110
我就只能被迫迎战了
I will be forced to accept your call to arms.

01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:33.560
听明白没有
Do you understand?

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:36.350
很好
Good.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.690
我能看出你现在不太舒服
Now, I can see you're feeling somewhat under the weather.

01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:43.910
那是因为我在你的茶里
That's because I spiked your tea

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:46.780
掺了一种志贺氏杆菌
with a nasty little parasitic genus called shigella.

01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:49.880
要是放任不管  日落之前
Left unattended, you will shit yourself to death

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.370
你就会腹泻而亡
before the sun doth set.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.080
我建议你吃了这两颗泡腾片
I suggest taking two of these fizzy biscuits.

01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:59.000
过一两个小时你就没事了
You'll be fine in an hour or two,

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.920
这时间也够让你反思一下之前的轻率之举了
long enough to consider your past indiscretions.

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:11.590
还有  乔治  如果我连你的厨房都进得去
And, George, if I can get to you in your own kitchen...

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.640
到哪我都能要了你的命
I can get to you anywhere.

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:25.190
-是你干的吗  -干什么
- Did you do it? - Do what?

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.650
你是不是打劫了迈奇·皮尔森的农场
Did you raid Mickey Pearson's farm?

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:32.030
-没有  -你是说  是茨奥背着你干的
- No. - So you're telling me that Phuc did this behind your back.

01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:35.830
这么说吧  他确实没当着我的面干这事
Well, let's just say this. He didn't do it in front of it.

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:37.920
他没经过我同意
He did it without my blessing.

01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:39.620
但你确实背着我
But you did go behind my back

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.420
提出要收购他的生意
and offer to buy his business.

01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:45.670
对  是我干的
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.510
我要用你警告我的话回敬你
Now, let me warn you the way you warn me.

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:55.510
长江后浪推前浪  前浪死在沙滩上
There comes a point where the young succeed the old.

01:14:56.610 --> 01:14:57.600
别逼我
Don't push me.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.870
有些事我不太清楚
There are some things I don't know about.

01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:07.200
干眼和乔治勋爵之间
Something between Dry Eye and Lord George.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:12.490
不管怎样  有人杀了乔治勋爵
Now, whatever it was, someone killed Lord George.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.370
其他人可能会觉得是你或者迈奇
Anyone else might think that was you or Mickey.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.910
我们继续刚才的小故事吧
Shall we continue with our little story?

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.710
你对这个有兴趣吗  雷蒙德
Does that arouse your interest, Raymond?

01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:28.340
所以说马修认识干眼
So Matthew knows Dry Eye.

01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:31.340
-那又怎样  -我也同意
- So what? - Well, yes, I agree.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.560
或许他们就只是见个面
Perhaps they were just meeting up

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.560
聊聊在马尔代夫度假的时光
to talk about holidaying in the Maldives

01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:38.390
或者脱欧的什么长远影响
or the long-term implications of leaving the EU.

01:15:38.610 --> 01:15:43.530
但我录像了  读唇语  翻译好了抄录下来
But I filmed it, had it lip-read, translated and transcribed.

01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:46.580
就像七四年那部经典电影《窃听大阴谋》
Rather like the classic 1974 film The Conversation,

01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:46.580
男主喜欢窃听别人对话

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.860
吉恩·哈克曼和约翰·凯泽尔主演的那部
starring Gene Hackman and John Cazale.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:52.570
《窃听大阴谋》是科波拉拍《教父》的间隙拍摄而成
You know, Coppola slipped that one out between the Godfathers.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.700
我不是很喜欢  说实话有点无聊
It wasn't really for me. It's a bit boring, to be honest.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.450
我得说  马修那人
Now, can I just say, that Matthew,

01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:00.120
他真有两下子  对吧
he's quite something, isn't he?

01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:02.330
他不是普普通通的美国人
He's not your average American.

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.080
他很有国际范  甚至会讲几句粤语
He's a Mr. International. Even speaks a bit of Cantonese.

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:11.550
坐过来  你演干眼  我演马修
Come here. You play Dry Eye and I shall be Matthew.

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:13.760
过来啊
Come on.

01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.800
好吧
All right.

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:24.950
努力跟他对上口型  好吗
Try and get it in time with his lips, all right?

01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:26.230
-好  知道了  -准备好了吗
- Yeah, yeah. - Ready?

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.230
开机  开拍
Roll camera. Action.

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:38.960
2002年  阿森纳

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:44.630
出了点情况  乔治勋爵
There was an incident. Lord George...

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.890
要命  雷蒙德
Fuck's sake, Raymond.

01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:47.120
你念得也太呆板了
It's a bit fucking wooden.

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.290
加点情感  多点活力
Put something into it, you know, a bit of welly.

01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:51.470
开拍
And action.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.750
出了点情况
There was an incident.

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:55.010
乔治勋爵没挺过来
Lord George didn't come through it.

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:56.310
没挺过来
Didn't come through it?

01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:59.090
你最不该做的就是引章鱼来
The last thing you need to do is attract any octopus.

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:00.100
章鱼
Octopus?

01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:04.610
什么意思  这翻译真不怎么样
What does that mean? It's not a very good translation.

01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:06.030
才不是  翻译好得很
No, there's nothing wrong with the translation.

01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:07.990
马修说得不是很溜  而且是粤语
Matthew's not that fluent. And it's Cantonese.

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.690
照着读吧  自己润色
Just go with it and fill in the blanks.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.190
开拍
And action.

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.690
都是迈克尔的错  怪他
It's all on Michael. He's to blame.

01:17:14.370 --> 01:17:16.070
这样做一点也不明智
That is not a smart move.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.130
别跟我说什么怎么做明智
Don't tell me what a smart move is.

01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:19.380
你说什么
I beg for your pardon.

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:20.990
你听得很清楚
You heard me perfectly well.

01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:23.800
迈克尔这么做会有好果子吃的
There will be repercussions for Michael's actions.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.580
你觉得现在你说了算吗
You think you're running things, do you?

01:17:26.010 --> 01:17:28.040
别碰我的老鼠毛
Don't stroke my mouse hair.

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.100
老鼠毛又是什么意思
What does "mouse hair" mean?

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.390
我觉得他是想说别破坏我的交易
Yeah, I think what he means is don't jeopardize my deal,

01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:34.420
但我承认这句确实让人摸不着头脑
but I admit that one's a bit of a googly.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.190
然后马修开始乱说
Then Matthew loses it a bit

01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:38.690
翻译就完全让人看不懂了
and his translation goes completely out of the window.

01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:41.690
什么春天  什么毛衣的
Something about springtime and sweaters.

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.510
我觉得他想说的是他很不开心
I think what he means is he's upset.

01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:44.820
然后干眼说了什么
And then Dry Eye says something,

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:46.150
但是有个傻逼突然跑到我前面
but some cunt moved in front of me,

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.280
某个傻逼

01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:47.520
所以我没拍到那部分
so I didn't get that either.

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:49.560
你的粤语烂透了
Your Cantonese is dog shit,

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:51.240
所以这句我就说英语吧
so I'm gonna say this in English

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.160
而且我只说一遍
and I'm gonna say it once,

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.980
给我听好了  鲁本斯坦
so listen to me, Rubenstein.

01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:58.280
结局会是这样
This is how it's gonna play out.

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:01.360
你退出
You're gonna back the fuck off...

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.660
我全盘接收
and I'm gonna take it all.

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:08.080
你还得向我表示敬意
And you will pay me my respect.

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.680
你也看到了  我就拍了这么多
And there you have it. That's all I've got.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.040
抱歉  节目演完了
Sorry. Show's over.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.130
但我觉得已经很清楚了
But I think it's quite clear

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:19.760
他们不仅仅是麻将牌友  对吧
that they're not just mah-jongg partners, are they?

01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:21.010
对吧
Mm?

01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:31.390
并不是一切都清楚了  弗莱彻
Not all of that was clear, Fletcher.

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.370
按你的说法
I mean, according to you,

01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:35.770
我们已经知道马修想买断迈克尔
we already know Matthew wants to buy Michael out.

01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:39.990
-这算什么新闻  -别担心  亲爱的
- So why is that news? - Oh, don't you worry, my darling.

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:42.070
我们会说到新闻的
We are gonna come to the news.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.530
我正要说到高潮的地方
I'm approaching my climax.

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.210
干眼
Dry Eye.

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:57.210
我相信你会让迈克尔·皮尔森付出代价的
I trust you will make Michael Pearson pay for this.

01:18:58.230 --> 01:18:59.760
你现在是龙首了
You are the dragon head now.

01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:02.010
巩固自己的地位
Solidify your position.

01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:04.760
我会的  叔叔
It will be done, Uncle.

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.930
干眼如愿以偿得以高升  对吧  雷蒙德
So Dry Eye got the upgrade he was after, didn't he, Raymond?

01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:11.610
问题在于  既然他现在当上了大哥
The question is, what was he gonna do with it

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:13.820
他打算做些什么
now that he's Billy Big Bollocks?

01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:15.230
给我十分钟  雷
Give me ten minutes, Ray.

01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:17.230
是  老大
Boss.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.210
维多利亚公主

01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:32.620
喂  罗莎
Hello, Ros.

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.620
今晚是约会之夜
It's date night tonight,

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:38.090
九点  我们俩  河滨餐厅
9:00 P.M., you and I, River Cafe.

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.050
九点吗  我会准时到的
Nine o'clock? I'll be there.

01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:45.340
我们打烊了
We're closed.

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.640
挂电话
Hang up.

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.810
不要
No.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.650
我叫你把电话挂了
Hang the fucking phone up.

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:52.230
谁在说话
Who's there?

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:55.690
罗莎  是谁
Ros, who's there?

01:19:56.370 --> 01:19:57.810
你怎么来了  干眼
What you doing here, Dry Eye?

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.360
越来越紧张了  对吧
It's warming up now, isn't it?

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:07.280
那时候  我猜你们还不知道
At this point, I'm guessing that you didn't even know

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:09.080
乔治勋爵已经死了
that Lord George was dead yet,

01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:11.660
更别说干眼想干什么了
let alone what Dry Eye was up to.

01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:14.540
你好  干眼  有何贵干
Hello, Dry Eye. What do you want?

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.300
吃硬糖吗
Fancy a boiled sweet?

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:31.140
-不吃  -随你的便
- No. - Suit yourself.

01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:40.820
他是谁
Who the fuck was he?

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.410
我不是很确定接下来发生了什么
I'm not exactly sure what happened next,

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.740
因为你们俩成功地甩掉了我
because you two managed to give me the slip.

01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:47.860
他们抓了罗莎兰  联系罗格
They got Rosalind. Call Roger.

01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:51.490
太好了  再来一瓶
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:54.120
等下  你在场
Hold on. You were there?

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.000
对  我当然在场
Yeah. Of course I was there.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.000
他不接电话  或许你应该系好安全带
He's not picking up. Maybe you should put your seat belt on.

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:06.220
我来打给罗莎兰  我来吧
Yeah, let me call Rosalind. Let me do it.

01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:09.800
我来弄  你看着路
I got it. Just watch the road.

01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.390
罗莎兰  别紧张
Now, Rosalind, don't be alarmed,

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.200
但你要跟我走一趟
but you're gonna come with me

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.810
直到我跟你丈夫把事情都谈妥了
until I can resolve all these issues with your husband.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:18.480
我哪里都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.520
她不接电话  就一直在响
She's not picking up. It's just ringing.

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:24.070
-妈的  -我们要不开慢一点
- Fuck. - I mean, we could just slow down a little bit.

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:27.240
妈的
Fuck!

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:43.670
你也清楚的
You know how it works.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.380
你要么乖乖跟我走
You either come with me or Tony here

01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:48.300
要么这位托尼就押着你跟我走
is gonna make you come with me.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.640
你在我的屋檐下  我的办公室里
You're in my office under my roof.

01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:53.110
你无权命令托尼做任何事
It's not your position for Tony to do anything

01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:55.600
除了让他从哪来滚回哪去
other than to fuck off back from whence he came.

01:21:56.660 --> 01:21:57.230
托尼
Tony.

01:21:59.410 --> 01:22:01.780
那是什么  镇纸吗
What's that? Is that a paperweight?

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:02.960
你那么说真是有意思
Funny you should say that.

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.410
原来有点重量的东西都能当镇纸
Turns out anything with weight can be a paperweight.

01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:07.830
-你打算用它干什么  -取决于你们  不是吗
- What are you gonna do with it? - Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:09.990
你们可以照我说的  滚出门去
Either you do as I tell you to and use the door,

01:22:10.210 --> 01:22:12.910
不然我就一枪爆了托尼的头
or I'm gonna shoot fat Tony right between the eyes.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.960
你也看到了  这枪只有两发子弹
You see, this gun's only got two bullets,

01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:17.510
所以我也不浪费唇舌了
so I'm not gonna fuck about illustrating its significance.

01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:19.120
你最好相信我
You're gonna have to trust me on that.

01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:21.500
另一个选项还是有点必然的
The alternative is a little bit absolute.

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.250
我得纠正下你的语法
I'm gonna have to check your grammar on that.

01:22:24.850 --> 01:22:27.170
必然不会只是"有点"
It can't be just a little bit absolute.

01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:29.850
要么是  要么不是
It either is or it isn't.

01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:32.510
不管怎样  我已经没有耐心了
Whatever it is, I've lost my patience.

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:34.780
我告诉你  我会扣下扳机
I'm telling you, I will squeeze this trigger

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.350
托尼就归西了
and Tony will be no more.

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:37.470
托尼
Tony.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.780
听我的  蠢货  你敢往前踏一步
Listen to me, cunt. You take one step forward,

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.040
这就是你这辈子最后一步
it'll be the last fucking step you ever take.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:45.980
托尼  动手
Tony, get on it.

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:23.270
你他妈敢
I fucking dare you.

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:26.520
你冷静点
Just calm down.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:28.900
我这就走
I'm leaving.

01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:38.370
你的两发子弹都打完了吧
I guess that's your two bullets, eh?

01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:40.140
罗莎兰
Rosalind!

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.760
罗莎兰
Rosalind!

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:03.730
趴着别动
Stay fucking still!

01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:12.280
你好啊  宝贝
Hello, babe.

01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:29.790
你好啊  亲爱的
Hello, love.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.960
所以你这故事的高潮
So you're basing your whole crescendo

01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:35.150
全是基于你的想象
on a figment of your imagination.

01:24:35.150 --> 01:24:39.070
我这故事的高潮全是基于对前情的总结
I'm basing my whole crescendo on the sum of its parts.

01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:41.780
抛开几个小细节不谈  把这个劲爆故事
A few minor details aside, I wouldn't have any trouble at all

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:45.140
卖给大戴夫一点问题也没有
selling this juicy peach of a drama to Big Dave.

01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:47.410
他会激动地射在自己的内裤上
He'd cream his fucking panties.

01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:49.910
你这么聪明  肯定不会勒索我们  弗莱彻
You're too smart to be blackmailing us, Fletcher.

01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:52.940
对  很明显我已经采取预防措施了
Yes, yes, and obviously I've taken precautionary measures.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.780
你想对我做什么可怕的事情都行
You can do all kinds of horrible things to me if you want.

01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:58.910
我甚至可能很享受
I might even enjoy them.

01:24:59.210 --> 01:25:01.780
但你们可能得离开这个国家  再也不能回来
But you'd have to leave the country and never come back.

01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:04.010
所以故事是结束了吗  弗莱彻
So is that the story over now, Fletcher?

01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:07.800
整个故事  说这么多都是为了引出下一章
All this, this whole buildup, was leading to this next part.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.170
这就是你之前问的新闻
This is the news that you were asking about before.

01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:11.920
准备好了吗
Ready?

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.510
马修
Matthew.

01:25:15.190 --> 01:25:17.350
他从迈克尔那买来的生意
He's gonna need some people to run his business here

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.010
总需要人来经营  是吧
when he buys it from Michael, right?

01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:21.970
他需要一个可靠的帮手  某个跟你一样的人
He's gonna need a reliable pair of hands, someone like you.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.140
他为什么没请你呢  雷蒙德
So why didn't he ask you, Raymond?

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.700
我不知道  与我无关
I don't know. It's none of my business.

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:28.020
我告诉你吧  因为
Because, I'll tell you,

01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:31.150
他已经有了心仪的人选
he already had someone earmarked for the role.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.110
干眼  他答应给干眼这份工作
Dry Eye. He promised Dry Eye the job,

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:38.210
但干眼必须要压低
but only if Dry Eye helped drive down

01:25:38.210 --> 01:25:39.460
迈奇这桩生意的价格
the price of Mickey's business.

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.920
是马修告诉了干眼
You see, it was Matthew who told Dry Eye

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.700
迈奇的农场在哪
the location of Mickey's farm,

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:46.260
这样他就能偷了他的白寡妇超级奶酪
so he could steal his white widow super cheese

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.710
制造麻烦  降低它的市场价值
to cause ripples and reduce the market value.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.380
所以接下来茨奥
And that is why Phuc, in turn,

01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:55.460
找了那些喝果汁  长痘痘的肌肉小伙去把事办了
got those juice-swilling, acne-backed muscle Marys to do the job.

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:57.510
是马修
It was Matthew

01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.760
设计了这么一个大局
who set this whole train of events off.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.550
但他没有想到的是...
But what he did not plan on, you see...

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:05.520
去你的  你这个老贱人
Fuck you, you old cunt!

01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:07.310
我会去你坟头撒尿的
I'll piss on your grave.

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:10.560
干眼
...was Dry Eye...

01:26:13.290 --> 01:26:14.520
杀了乔治勋爵
killing Lord George.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.710
现在干眼再也不想对马修卑躬屈膝了
Now, Dry Eye does not want to be subservient to Matthew anymore.

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:21.320
不想对任何人卑躬屈膝
Doesn't wanna be subservient to anyone.

01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:23.030
结局会是这样
This is how it's gonna play out.

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:26.200
你退出
You're gonna back the fuck off

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:28.330
我全盘接收
and I'm gonna take it all.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:32.750
干眼喜欢权力的味道  但不喜欢马修
Dry Eye likes the smell of power and does not like Matthew.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:35.390
所以  这条小龙需要有人稍稍点拨他一下
So, the little dragon needed a gentle reminder

01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:37.310
让他知道谁才是真正主事的人
of who was really running things.

01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:39.270
你刚进这个戏水池才两分钟
You've been in this paddling pool for two minutes.

01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:42.480
而我已经在满是鲨鱼的海里游泳二十年了
I've been swimming in the ocean with the sharks for 20 years.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:44.930
我来告诉你结局该是怎么样的
I'll tell you how this plays out.

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.060
你会溺死
You will drown...

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.230
然后我的摩萨德蟹会吃了你
and then my Mossad crabs will eat you.

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.230
摩萨德为以色列情报机构

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.070
摩萨德蟹

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:54.580
亲爱的  这就是我想要两千万的原因
And this, my love, is why I want

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:56.330
这钱是我辛辛苦苦赚来的
my hard-earned 20 million pounds.

01:26:56.330 --> 01:27:00.030
因为我不仅知道
Because not only do I know exactly

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:02.160
迈奇的生意是怎么运作的
how Mickey's business operates,

01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:06.160
我还知道他想要出手卖给的人
but I also know that the very man he's trying to sell it to

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.370
想要逼他低价卖出
is trying to force him into selling it on the cheap

01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:12.750
并间接引发了一场战争
and has indirectly started a war.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.390
所以我觉得你应该
So, you see, I think you should be

01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:16.540
把我当做你值得信赖的军师
calling me your trusted consigliere,

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.140
或是说你的幕后间谍
or your spy behind the lines,

01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:23.050
如果你愿意的话  也可以叫作情报侦察员
your intellectual reconnaissance, if you prefer.

01:27:24.690 --> 01:27:25.760
你真有一手
I'm impressed.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.060
你肯定知道得比我多
You certainly know more than I do.

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:32.020
我不仅很意外你知道这么多
I'm impressed not only by your information,

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:34.400
还很意外你的想象力如此丰富
but by your imagination.

01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:36.360
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:40.900
所以给你七十二小时
So you've got 72 hours.

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:45.170
重申一遍  要是我有什么不测
And I would just reiterate that if anything happens to me,

01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:47.700
我已经做好了保险措施
I do have my insurance policy in place.

01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:51.220
所有东西都会到大戴夫那  然后再由他公开
Everything will go to Big Dave, and from him to the public,

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:53.040
至于你  我的亲爱的  会被送上火星
and you, my love, will go to Mars.

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:56.500
所以我强烈建议  把钱付了
So, strong recommendation, just pay up

01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:01.880
然后看着我抛着飞吻消失在落日的余晖之中  好吗
and watch me recede into the sunset blowing kisses, yes?

01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:09.280
好吧  该开门送客了  你这个黑杂种
Well, then, time to use the door, you black bastard.

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.520
真是笑话  是吧  我又不是黑人
Well, that's just silly, isn't it, 'cause I'm not black.

01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:14.560
没错  但你的灵魂是黑的  你这个黑心贱人
No, but your fucking soul is, you dark cunt.

01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:19.820
从我家滚出去  因为我要睡觉了
Now, out of my house, 'cause I'm going to bed.

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.530
我能和你一起吗
Can I come with you?

01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:27.960
不能  但你可以去吸一吸
No, but you can go smoke the exhaust pipe

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:29.590
你的灵车后面排气管的尾气
in the back of your hearse.

01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:32.430
不管怎样我都要射的
I might come anyway.

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.930
你会听到我在黑暗中自慰
You'll just hear me scratching about in the dark,

01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:39.100
最后射在手帕上
wanking into a hanky.

01:28:44.230 --> 01:28:46.940
好了  两千万
All right, so, 20 million.

01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:50.280
你有七十二小时  开始计时
You've got 72 hours, starting now.

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.700
时间滴滴答答不等人
Ticktock, ticktock.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:55.910
我走了
And I'm gone.

01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:01.040
滴答
Ticktock.

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.520
他刚走
He's just left.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.810
他自认为很聪明
He thinks he's very clever.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.020
从大戴夫开始
Start with Big Dave.

01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:29.320
这件事就你我知道  哈米
Now, you keep this between you and me, Hammy,

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.490
但弗莱彻和我一直有联系
but Fletcher's been in touch.

01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:32.160
他说他有我们需要的东西
He says he's got what we need.

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.610
小心点  老大  谁出价高弗莱彻就给谁
Careful, boss. Fletcher's ass belongs to the highest bidder.

01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:36.570
是  他说他要十五万
Yeah. He says he wants 150 grand.

01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:39.160
但如果货真价实  就是整整一周的独家新闻
But if it's proper, it's worth a whole week's exclusive.

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.330
他手上究竟有什么料
Well, what does he have exactly?

01:29:40.330 --> 01:29:41.700
他现在只是在卖关子
He was just tickling me nuts,

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:43.460
但他说想要周六见面
but he says he wants to meet Saturday.

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:44.810
所以留出时间来
So keep it free.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.400
编辑办公室

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:48.550
是  马上
Yeah, pronto.

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:58.390
你不能停在这  伙计  把车移走
You can't park there, mate. Move the van.

01:29:58.390 --> 01:30:00.470
别担心  朋友  我们马上就走
Don't worry, friend. We'll be gone in a minute.

01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:02.600
我们做的不是报纸  我们做的是猎杀运动
We're not a newspaper. We're a blood sport.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.790
日报
正门  总部

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:04.730
拉斯  把车移开
Russ. Move the van.

01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:06.020
我在处理了  老板
I'm on it, boss.

01:30:06.810 --> 01:30:08.650
移走  快点
Move it. Now.

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.190
我说了马上就走
I said in a minute.

01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:12.610
蠢货
Spunk bubble.

01:30:12.610 --> 01:30:14.820
快把车给我开走
Get rid of the fucking van.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:23.420
我警告你  拉斯会空手道
I'm warning you, Russ does karate.

01:30:27.790 --> 01:30:29.340
小心点  伙伴们
Careful, boys.

01:30:30.090 --> 01:30:31.550
拉斯会空手道
Russ does karate.

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:34.550
拉斯  你要是识趣的话
Russ, if you know what's good for you,

01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:37.010
马上到车上去
get in the car now.

01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:43.600
抱歉  老大  我只是蓝带
Sorry, boss. I'm only a blue belt.

01:30:45.610 --> 01:30:46.480
你这个胆小鬼
You melt.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:51.280
怎么  现在是要拍YouTube视频吗
Now what? We're making a YouTube movie? Eh?

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:53.320
霹雳舞
Break dancing?

01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:57.530
我警告你们  我可是有权有势
I'm warning you. I'm fucking powerful.

01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:58.490
我们都知道
We know all that.

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:00.580
你不如到车后座和我们仔细说说吧
Why don't you tell us all about it in the back of the van?

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:04.120
我不去  我才不...不
I'm not going. I'm not fucking... No!

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.410
该死的...不
Fucking... No.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.250
把他弄上去
Get him in there.

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.460
难以置信
Unbelievable.

01:31:16.630 --> 01:31:17.590
好吧  好吧
Well, well, well.

01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:22.770
你没事了  大戴夫
You're all right, Big Dave.

01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:23.720
你现在安全了
You're in safe hands now.

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:26.810
-不必慌张  好吧  -你是谁
- No need to panic, okay? - Who are you?

01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:28.400
现在不用担心这个
Don't worry about that right now.

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:30.520
听着...
Look...

01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:33.280
听着  不管发生了什么
Look, whatever's gone on here,

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.690
我只想回去工作
I just need to get back to work.

01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.780
如果你放我走  我就当什么都没发生过
If you let me go, I'll just forget all about it.

01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:39.820
我会马上送你回去工作的  朋友
I'll have you back to work in short order, my friend.

01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:41.370
我知道你是个记者
Now, I believe you're a reporter.

01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:44.370
我有件事想告诉你
And there's something I wanna report to you.

01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.790
好像在这段短暂的时间内
Now, it seems for this brief moment in time

01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:49.000
我找到了进军电影业的门路
I've found my way into the film business,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.790
昨晚  我制作了一部电影
and last night I made a film

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:54.050
主角是一头巨型农场猪
with an impressively sized farmyard pig.

01:31:58.010 --> 01:32:00.760
早上好  先生  两杯茶
Morning, sir. Two cups of tea.

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:03.100
一杯加了糖  一杯没有
One with sugar, one without.

01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:05.230
好了  你们走开吧  让我们单独聊聊
All right, lads, go on, give us a minute.

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.940
你的肩膀上方有些湿巾
There are some wet wipes there over your shoulder.

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:12.320
你的衣服也被整齐叠好  放在了椅子上
Your clothes are neatly folded there on the bench.

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.820
等你准备好了
Now, in due course,

01:32:14.190 --> 01:32:16.280
你就会按下这台电脑的空格键
you're gonna press the space bar on this computer

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:19.700
你就能见证你在这部电影中的戏份了
and you're gonna witness your participation in said film.

01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:23.490
我们昨晚给你下的那个药真是
Now, that little drug we gave you last night really...

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.000
让你兽性大发
loosened up your inhibitions, man.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:28.620
你若是想阻止这个小小的创意作品
The only thing you'll need to do

01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:31.250
轰动整个社交媒体
to stop this little creative expression

01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:33.710
你只用做一件事
from becoming a social media sensation

01:32:33.710 --> 01:32:37.010
就是以后别再针对迈奇·皮尔森了
is lose any interest you have in the future of Mickey Pearson.

01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:40.220
我先离开了  你自己收拾一下自己吧
I'm gonna leave you now to clean yourself up.

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.680
空格键  记住了  还有喝杯热茶
Space bar, yeah? Have a hot drink as well.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.510
可能会让你更舒服点
It might make you feel a little bit better.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.640
你昨晚累坏了
It was a fucking rough night for you.

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:50.730
观看愉快
Enjoy the show.

01:32:57.230 --> 01:33:01.780
♪ 老麦克唐纳有座农场  咿呀咿呀呦 ♪
♪ Old MacDonald Had a farm, e-i-e-i-o ♪

01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:04.580
♪ 他的农场里有头猪... ♪
♪ And on that farm he had a pig... ♪

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:05.990
他还好吗  教练
How's your man, then, coach?

01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.700
死不了
He'll survive.

01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:08.620
但我可不会选那头猪
Wouldn't have been the pig I would have chosen, though.

01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:14.750
我们都知道那是哪段
We know what bit that is.

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:18.710
我来挠挠你的肚子
Let me tickle that belly.

01:33:18.710 --> 01:33:21.090
你可真淘气
You are so naughty.

01:33:21.670 --> 01:33:24.430
-我的天  -我当时就在场  现在看还是很震撼
- Good Lord. - I mean, I was there and I'm still shocked.

01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:26.010
为我尖叫吧  小猪
Squeal for me, piggy.

01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:29.350
-他是我想的那个人吗  -是  当然是
- Is that who I think it is? - Yeah, it certainly is.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:32.940
这是你设计的
And that's your doing?

01:33:33.230 --> 01:33:34.770
苹果酱呢
Where is that applesauce?

01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:37.480
真是让人过目不忘  对吗
You can't unsee it once you've seen it, can you?

01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.570
是  完全忘不了  简直就是噩梦制造机
No, you can't unsee it. It's nightmare fuel.

01:33:39.570 --> 01:33:40.940
要缠着我一辈子了
That will be with me forever.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.570
那篇报道不会发布了
That story won't be running.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.280
好吧  还有一件事需要你做
Right. I've got one more thing I need you to do.

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:51.910
先打断一下  雷
Look, before you continue, Ray,

01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:54.380
我训练这帮小伙是希望他们学好
I train lads to be good lads.

01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:56.040
我不是混黑帮的
I'm not a fucking gangster.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.590
我已经被迫做了些黑帮的事
Now, I've been forced to do some gangster things,

01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:59.630
这都算了
that's okay.

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.510
但我不是也不是什么要求都照做
But I'm not the gift that keeps on giving.

01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:02.510
所以无意冒犯
So with the greatest respect,

01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:05.760
这是我帮你做的最后一件事  到此为止
I'll do this one last thing for you and then that's it.

01:34:05.970 --> 01:34:06.970
结束了
No más.

01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:09.350
我帮你三次了  我不干了
Three strikes and I'm out.

01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:18.360
-一切还好吗  教练  -不  厄尼  不好
- Everything all right, Coach? - No, Ernie, it isn't.

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:21.070
你们得明白自己行为的严重性
You need to understand the severity of your actions.

01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:29.990
戴夫  一小时
Dave, an hour.

01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:30.910
好的  老大
Okay, boss.

01:34:33.730 --> 01:34:36.340
苏格兰阿伯丁
尖峰鲜鱼公司

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.630
谢谢你的盛情招待
Thank you for the grand tour.

01:34:38.210 --> 01:34:39.460
我心悦诚服
I'm a believer.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:40.880
谢谢  伙计们
Thank you, chaps.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.470
可以谈最后的价格了吗
Now, are we ready to finalize the numbers?

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:47.930
我们不是谈好了吗
We already have.

01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:51.680
形势已经变了  迈克尔
The situation's changed, Michael.

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.100
-市场变了  -怎么说
- The market's changed. - How so?

01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:58.690
你这桩生意的脱手价需要重新计算
The exit value of your business needs to be recalculated.

01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:01.270
请详细点
Please, be specific.

01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:02.360
好的
I will be.

01:35:03.150 --> 01:35:06.740
你有十二处种植场地和一个分销网络  要价四亿
You're asking 400 for 12 locations and a distribution network,

01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.530
当时来看  这个价格很合理
which was a fair valuation at the time.

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.240
但现在  有一处场子位置被泄露
But when one of those locations was compromised,

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.750
其余场地的价值也受到了波及
the value of all those locations were compromised

01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:16.870
这当然会影响价格
and this obviously affects the price.

01:35:17.290 --> 01:35:21.000
你的大麻农场在YouTube上火了  迈克尔
Your skunk farm was a fucking viral sensation on YouTube, Michael.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.800
等消息传到条子那去时  这也是迟早的事
And when Johnny Law starts sniffing, which he will,

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:25.800
所有场地都得停产
all of those locations will have to cease production

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.380
我看至少得十二个月
for, I'd say, at least 12 months

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:29.760
每年净损失一亿
at a cost of 100 million net P.A.,

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.470
这还没有算上人员流失  搬迁
before marking down the loss of staff,

01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:32.720
和场地租金的费用
relocation and site rentals.

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.600
-你还在听我说吗  -是的  我在听
- You still with me? - Yes, I'm following.

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.430
至少需要三年
It will take at least three years

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.770
才能使你的供应分销和市场需求
to get your supply, distribution and demand

01:35:38.770 --> 01:35:40.520
完全恢复
back to full capacity.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:44.440
你的人力成本占一亿运营成本的四分之一
Your staffing costs are 25% of your 100 million operational cost,

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:48.110
也就是说接下来三年内  每年两千五百万
so that's 25 million per annum for three annums.

01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:50.530
场地租金每年一千五百万
And location rental at 15 million a year,

01:35:50.530 --> 01:35:54.700
一亿两千万英镑就没了
that's a 120 GBP bite right there.

01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:57.000
你的单位经济效益遭受重创
Your unit economics have taken a hit,

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.830
以目前的不利形势
and forecasting out your top-line growth margin

01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:02.080
预测你的营收增长率
in the current inimical climate,

01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:05.590
据我估算  一个月前价值四亿的资产
I calculate what was worth 400 million a month ago

01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:10.430
现在肯定大缩水到一亿三千万了
must now be valued at an anemic,130.

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:15.140
重点不是第一块倒地的多米诺骨牌  迈克尔
You see, it's not about the first domino that fell, Michael.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:17.190
而是最后一块
It's about the last.

01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:20.150
请
Please.

01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:26.740
我喜欢你  迈克尔  你是个好人
I like you, Michael. You're a good chap.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.360
如果你想让我帮你摆脱现在的困境
And if you want me to help you out of this hole you've found yourself in,

01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:34.950
我今天就能付给你一亿美元
I can pay you 100 million dollars today.

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:37.960
这价不低了  而且现在就能付给你
It's a good offer and it's real,

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.750
我愿意这么做  因为我是你的朋友
and I'll do this because I'm your friend.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.750
我的会计一小时内就能转账
My accountant can transfer the fee within the hour.

01:36:44.710 --> 01:36:47.050
我喜欢你把这事比成多米诺骨牌
I like your domino analogy.

01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:52.850
我的问题是  谁推倒了第一块多米诺骨牌
The question I ask is, who tumbled the first domino?

01:36:53.050 --> 01:36:56.010
恐怕这不是我关心的  也不关我的事  迈克尔
I'm afraid that's not my concern or my business, Michael.

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:57.930
恕我顶触
At the risk of contradicting you,

01:36:57.930 --> 01:37:02.440
这绝对关你的事  你肯定也关心
it is very much your business, and certainly your concern.

01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:05.440
只是你犯了一个错误
Only you made one mistake.

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.820
是什么
That being?

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.530
你似乎在把我当傻子耍
You seem to have mistaken me for some kind of a cunt.

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.620
请容我向你介绍第一块多米诺骨牌
Let me introduce you to the first domino.

01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:21.370
有点戏剧化了  不是吗
It's a tad dramatic, isn't it,

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:23.260
冻库里的尸体
corpses in freezers?

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:24.370
这人是谁
Who is this man?

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.500
他和我说的事又有什么关系
What's he got to do with anything that I'm talking about?

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:29.380
我就当你是在否认
I take it with that statement you are in denial

01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:32.010
和这个被冻起来的中国佬有某种关系
of so-said relationship with this frozen Chinaman?

01:37:32.010 --> 01:37:34.300
我当然否认
Well, of course I'm in denial of it.

01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:38.140
我和这个死掉的冷冻中国佬没有任何关系
I don't have relationships with dead, frozen Chinamen.

01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:41.940
事已至此就别再抵赖了  马修
Best not to be glib at this time in the proceedings, Matthew.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:47.480
不用费心找你的摩萨德蟹了
Don't bother looking for your Mossad crabs.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:48.770
这里是鱼市
This is a fish market.

01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:50.070
他们找到归宿了
They have found a home.

01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:53.740
说真的  我不认识那个人
To be clear, I do not know that man.

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:57.280
我来告诉你结局该是怎么样的
I'll tell you how this plays out.

01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:59.370
你会溺死
You will drown

01:37:59.950 --> 01:38:02.330
然后我的摩萨德蟹会吃了你
and then my Mossad crabs will eat you.

01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:04.210
所以你这边还在谈论着
So while you were discussing

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:07.800
你毁了我的生意后谁来接手
who would take over my business after you fucked it,

01:38:08.630 --> 01:38:11.920
这边又不知怎地把这个中国佬错认成别人了吗
you somehow mistook so-said Chinaman for someone else?

01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:16.090
生意归生意  迈克尔
Business is business, Michael.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.140
不牵扯私人恩怨
It's nothing personal.

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.890
我不会为了钱急眼
While I am not emotional about the money,

01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:22.270
但我在摆平你搞出的烂摊子时
there is a price indebted to me

01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:23.980
双手沾上了血
for the blood I've gotten on my hands

01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:27.360
这个债要算在你头上
restoring order to the untidiness that you created,

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.270
而这价格  据你所说...
and that price, according to you...

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:33.360
四亿减去一亿三千万  那就是两亿七千万美元
400 minus 130... is 270 million dollars.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.490
而且生意继续归我
And I'm keeping the business,

01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:41.200
我要把你关进冻库
while you are getting in the freezer.

01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:43.160
想从冻库出来
And you will make that transaction

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:44.450
就转账给我
if you want to get out of the freezer.

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:46.500
里面是零下二十五度
It is 25 below zero in there,

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:49.460
我猜你大概能撑一小时
so I assume you'll last about an hour.

01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:50.960
也就是说  别耍花样
That said, I wouldn't fuck about,

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.750
因为手指脚趾可禁不起冻
because frostbite is very expensive on the fingers and toes,

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.740
所以要我是你  就会趁着手脚还能动
so I would type as quickly as possible

01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:57.760
尽快转账
while you have the use of them.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:00.430
你为你的轻率买完单后
After you've attended to that indiscretion,

01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:03.190
就可以处理下你目光短浅
you can then deal with the next consequence

01:39:03.190 --> 01:39:04.600
造成的后果了
of your shortsightedness.

01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:08.900
我说过  我不会为了钱急眼
As stated, I am not emotional about the money.

01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:12.990
但有人动了我的妻子
But I am emotional about the fact

01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:15.240
我就会急眼了
that someone laid their hands on my wife.

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:19.950
我的妻子
My wife!

01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:24.160
在这世上不管多少钱
No amount of money on God's green earth

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:26.040
也不能弥补你对我妻子的侵犯  马修
can pay for that transgression, Matthew.

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.380
没有  为此...
No, for that...

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:32.960
我要一磅肉
I want a pound of flesh.

01:39:33.710 --> 01:39:34.970
一磅肉
A pound of flesh?

01:39:35.170 --> 01:39:38.800
我不在乎你从哪个部位割
It matters not to me where on your anatomy it is withdrawn from.

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:42.810
如果你没胆自己割
If you don't have the stomach to take it for yourself,

01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:45.010
大巴尼刀法纯熟
big Bunny here is very adept with a knife,

01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:47.020
你也看到了  他穿得很厚实
and, as you can see, he's dressed for the weather.

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:51.440
这块肉少了一分一毫
But a penny short or a gram shy...

01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:55.150
冻库门就不会开
and that freezer door does not open.

01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:56.490
明白了吗
Am I clear?

01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:58.700
很好
Good.

01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:01.450
-巴尼  -来了
- Bunny. - Incoming.

01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:16.840
怎么  早餐又吃和牛吗  雷蒙德
What, is it Wagyu again for breakfast, Raymond?

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.220
你不准备把我介绍给
Aren't you gonna introduce me

01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:23.100
你这位有点吓人的神秘朋友吗
to your mysterious and slightly menacing friend?

01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:30.100
那是干什么的  给我装钱的吗
What's that for? Is that for my money?

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.650
我的钱呢  雷蒙德
Where's my money, Raymond?

01:40:33.650 --> 01:40:34.980
你的报酬在那儿
There's your payment.

01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:40.110
打开看看
Go on, take a look.

01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:42.780
谢谢你  神秘的陌生人
Thank you, mysterious stranger.

01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:53.540
真让人失望
Well, that's disappointing,

01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:55.340
这看起来不像两千万英镑
'cause that doesn't look like 20 million pounds.

01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:58.510
比那更有趣  你的保险措施
It's more interesting than that, your insurance policy,

01:40:58.670 --> 01:40:59.840
所有照片  所有尸体
all the photos, all the bodies,

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:02.260
所有秘密  所有脏料
all the skeletons, all the filth.

01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:05.270
又不是独一份  亲爱的  我又不傻
It's not the only one, darling. I'm not a mong.

01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:08.560
你觉得里面是什么  白痴
What do you think's in that, you fucking eejit?

01:41:09.810 --> 01:41:12.190
马修的企图我们当然了如指掌
Of course we were aware of what Matthew was up to.

01:41:12.190 --> 01:41:14.320
我们不是大白痴
We're not complete fucking idiots.

01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:18.900
我盯上你很久了  弗莱彻
I've been onto you for a long time, Fletcher.

01:41:19.530 --> 01:41:21.240
我知道你一直跟踪迈克尔
I knew you'd been following Michael.

01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:23.450
我们的工作很相似
They're very similar, our jobs.

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.200
只不过我比你更专业
Only I'm better at it than you are.

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:29.500
我知道你那晚来
I knew when you came over that night that

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.460
只会待半个小时
you'd only be there for half an hour...

01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:34.330
下午好  雷蒙德
Buenas tardes, Raymondo.

01:41:34.330 --> 01:41:37.500
告诉我你多么聪明  想敲诈我们
to tell me how clever you are and try to blackmail us.

01:41:38.250 --> 01:41:40.170
我有非常重要的消息要告诉你
I've got some very important information to impart to you,

01:41:40.170 --> 01:41:40.840
雷蒙德
Raymond.

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.600
我也知道你无法拒绝
I also knew you couldn't resist

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.220
一千五百英镑一瓶的纯麦威士忌
a ￡1500 single malt,

01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:45.680
八十英镑的和牛牛排
an ￡80 Wagyu steak

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:47.850
还有最先进的
and a state-of-the-art smokeless barbie

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:49.890
可以暖脚的无烟烧烤
that even keeps your feet warm.

01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:51.060
我喜欢户外烧烤
I love a barbie.

01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:52.100
我向你保证
I promise you,

01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.350
如果你不听会后悔的
you will regret this if you don't hear it.

01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:56.810
一瓶威士忌下肚
And when the Scotch got into your cold veins,

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:59.690
你就失去了你那敏锐的直觉
you lost the benefit of your sharp instincts.

01:42:00.110 --> 01:42:02.030
太好了  再来一瓶
Goody. Another bottle.

01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:04.070
你能让这位神秘先生放松吗
Can you tell the mysterious gentleman to relax?

01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:05.150
因为我向你保证
Because I promise you,

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.240
你不听会后悔的
you will regret it if you don't hear this.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:09.280
-坐下  亲爱的  -我留你在那
- Sit down, my love. - See, I kept you there

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.870
是因为我需要知道马修和干眼的事
'cause I needed to know about Matthew and Dry Eye.

01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:15.750
我们找了很久才找到你的保险措施
Took us a while to find your insurance policies.

01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:14.460
邮箱公司

01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:19.590
因为你是只淘气的松鼠  弗莱彻
'Cause you're a naughty squirrel, Fletcher.

01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:22.760
弗莱彻  进屋脱鞋
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.840
是  妈妈
Yes, Mommy.

01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:28.560
但我在你鞋里放上跟踪器就简单多了
But it was made a lot easier after I planted a tracker in your shoe.

01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:35.310
在我们面前你永远都成不了掠食者  弗莱彻
You're never gonna be a predator with us, Fletcher.

01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:38.570
你永远都是猎物
You're always gonna be prey.

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:41.230
好了
So that's it.

01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:43.280
三件事都完成了  我们两清了  对吧
Three strikes. We're good, right?

01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:47.280
回见
I'll see you around.

01:42:47.650 --> 01:42:49.080
无意冒犯  还是不要见了
With the greatest respect, I hope not.

01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:59.920
弗莱彻  你刚说什么来着
Now, Fletcher, what were you saying?

01:43:00.710 --> 01:43:03.380
不是乔治勋爵盯上了迈奇
It wasn't Lord George that was after Mickey,

01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:05.800
也不是干眼或马修
or Dry Eye, or Matthew.

01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:08.430
你想知道是谁吗
Do you wanna know who it was?

01:43:12.850 --> 01:43:14.180
我有照片
I've got photos.

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.850
好吧  给你三十秒
Right. You've got 30 seconds.

01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:20.020
谢谢你  亲爱的
Thank you, darling.

01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:23.730
操
Fuck.

01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:27.030
大主角  怎么了
Primetime, what is it, son?

01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:29.990
教练  我们会帮你解决这件事
Coach, we're gonna take care of this for you.

01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:31.240
厄尼有个计划
Ernie's got a plan.

01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:33.040
你到底在说什么
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:43:33.490 --> 01:43:34.960
迈克尔那事
The Michael situation.

01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:36.840
我们会解决的
We're gonna sort it.

01:43:38.210 --> 01:43:39.920
大主角  听着  大主...
Primetime, listen... Prime...

01:43:41.630 --> 01:43:42.590
老天
Jesus.

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:55.680
你还记得阿斯兰吧
Now, you remember Aslan, don't you?

01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:58.400
你塞进冰柜的年轻人
The young gentleman you kept in the freezer?

01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:04.190
这是老阿斯兰
Well, this is Aslan Senior,

01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:05.860
俄罗斯寡头
Russian oligarch.

01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:09.280
前克格勃成员  做煤气管道生意发了家
Ex-KGB. Made all his money in gas pipes.

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:10.620
他唯一的儿子
And he's extremely sad

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.950
从窗户跌下楼让他悲痛欲绝
that his one-and-only son fell out of a window.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:14.660
见鬼
Shit.

01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:17.580
雷蒙德  我担心上次他们没干成的事
And I fear that where they failed before, Raymond,

01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.210
这次不会再失手了
they're not gonna fail again.

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:21.540
你怎么知道这些
And how do you know all this?

01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:23.130
因为有人把迈克尔的事
Because someone told them everything

01:44:23.130 --> 01:44:24.540
统统告诉了他们
they want to know about Michael,

01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:27.510
那个人就是我
and that someone is me.

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:29.550
继续
Go on.

01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:33.890
我说我愿意有偿告诉他们迈克尔在哪里
So I said I'd tell them where Michael was for a price.

01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:36.640
但他们要事成之后
But that money was pending till after,

01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:38.480
才付钱
you know, the deed was done.

01:44:40.230 --> 01:44:41.770
他们第一次搞砸后
And then when they messed up the first time,

01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:45.150
我又想了想  想出了第二代计划
I had a little rethink and came up with my version 2.0 plan,

01:44:45.150 --> 01:44:47.320
就是我来见你那时
which is when I came to see you.

01:44:47.690 --> 01:44:50.490
先从迈克尔身上捞到两千万
You see, get my 20 mils off Michael first

01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:52.820
然后  成事后
and then, after the event,

01:44:53.150 --> 01:44:55.030
再拿一笔  双倍报酬
get paid again, double bubble.

01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:57.200
但被你和你那位神秘的朋友给搅黄了
But you and your mysterious friend put paid to that,

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.370
干得漂亮
so well done, you.

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.000
你刚刚看表做什么
Why did you just look at your watch?

01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:03.380
我说了
Well, it's like I say.

01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:05.380
俄罗斯人会给整间房来个大扫除
The Russians are gonna clean house.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.800
你也是那间房的一部分  雷蒙德
And you are part of that house, Raymond.

01:45:09.010 --> 01:45:09.880
他们会在迈克尔
They're gonna get Michael

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:12.350
从鱼市会面出来后抓住他
when he comes out of his meeting at the fish market.

01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:14.600
然后来这里
And they are coming here.

01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:16.060
你明白我做了什么吗
So you see what I've done there?

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:17.970
告诉你就是救了你的命
By telling you, I've saved your lives.

01:45:17.970 --> 01:45:20.100
也就是救了我自己一命  不是吗
Which I think in turn saves mine, doesn't it?

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.900
别动
Don't fucking move.

01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:29.840
别上车  老大

01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.910
戴夫
Dave.

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:32.570
戴夫
Dave?

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:43.210
没有戴夫
No Dave.

01:45:43.630 --> 01:46:02.390
