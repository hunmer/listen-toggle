03:02.420 --> 03:04.610
他们付你多少  我加倍

03:04.610 --> 03:07.700
我不会说广东话  贵...
I don't speak Cantonese, Mister...

03:08.830 --> 03:11.070
我都懒得尝试了
Well, I'm not even gonna attempt that.

03:11.070 --> 03:13.430
但我初二上了西班牙语课  所以...
But I did take 8th grade Spanish, so...

03:13.580 --> 03:15.730
图书馆在哪里

03:15.730 --> 03:17.750
这句话的字面意义就是...
Which literally translates to...

03:18.890 --> 03:21.110
我不讨价还价  南瓜蠢蛋
I don't bargain, pumpkin fucker.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.350

03:34.350 --> 03:35.700
对不起
I am so sorry.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.780
我以为这是肛门漂白派对

05:32.160 --> 05:34.130
我不讨价还价

06:41.960 --> 06:42.950
操
Fuck.

06:44.020 --> 06:46.020
看起来你还留了点空档
Looks like you left a little landing strip there.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.110
我喜欢
I like it.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.880
天啊
Oh, man!

06:58.160 --> 06:59.820
我的世界巡演带我回到了家

to this guy, Sergei Valishnikov.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.400
家  美好的家

07:02.660 --> 07:04.300
但是我们等会儿再说他
But we'll get to him in a moment.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.620
我知道你们都在想什么
'Cause I know what you're thinking.

07:05.620 --> 07:08.490
"还好把孩子们都安顿在家里了"
"I'm so glad I left the kiddos at home."

07:08.490 --> 07:09.930
但是你错了
But that's where you'd be wrong.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.210
你的保姆现在正嗨翻了天
That babysitter of yours is high as fuck right now...

07:13.210 --> 07:17.660
以及信不信由你  《死侍2》是一部家庭电影
and, believe it or not, Deadpool 2 is a family film.

07:17.660 --> 07:18.590
千真万确
True story.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.510
每一部优秀家庭电影的开头都是一起可怕的谋杀
And every good family film starts with a vicious murder.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.610
《小鹿斑比》  《狮子王》  《电锯惊魂7》
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.

07:25.610 --> 07:28.930
我的上帝啊  那家伙着火了
Holy shit pickles! That guy's on fire.

07:28.930 --> 07:31.910
那可不是电脑特效  伙计们  他真的着火了
That's not CGI, folks. He's actually on fire.

07:31.910 --> 07:35.280
你知道我是靠抓坏蛋挣钱的吧
Yeah. You know I get paid to take out bad guys, right?

07:35.280 --> 07:36.340
但是这家伙
But this guy?

07:36.340 --> 07:38.270
他是最坏的坏蛋之一
He was one of the worst of 'em.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.830
赶紧把门打开
Hurry up and open this fucking door,

07:42.830 --> 07:44.590
一起杀掉这混蛋
and let's kill this motherfucker!

07:51.110 --> 07:52.670
真恶心
Ugh. So gross.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.680
安全屋  认真的吗
A panic room? Really?

07:56.010 --> 07:57.660
你能出来吗
Can you come out?

07:58.250 --> 08:01.560
我真的得走了  今天是我的纪念日
I really have to go. It's my anniversary.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.200
我总能听到人们一遍又一遍地说
Over and over, I hear people say,

08:08.200 --> 08:10.100
"我就是没有足够的自信"
"I just don't have enough confidence."

08:10.100 --> 08:12.150
听着  自信不是你拥有的东西
Listen, confidence is not something you have.

08:12.150 --> 08:13.640
而是你创造的东西
It's something you create.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.700
你随时都能创造出来
And you can create it at any moment in time.

08:15.710 --> 08:17.270
自信的感觉只不过
A sense of confidence is nothing

08:17.270 --> 08:19.010
是你内心中的力量
but a sense of power within yourself...

08:19.010 --> 08:20.930
让你能够确信你能获得成功
a sense of certainty that you can pull something off.

08:20.930 --> 08:23.030
他妈的快开车
Start the fucking car!

08:23.030 --> 08:24.000
都朋德
Dopinder!

08:24.000 --> 08:25.920
他妈的快开车
Start the fucking car!

08:30.310 --> 08:32.850
打死那混蛋  打他
Shoot that motherfucker! Shoot him!

08:33.350 --> 08:34.370
我吓得拉裤子了
Oh, I shit my pants.

08:34.370 --> 08:37.170
其实可能是我拉的
Actually, that may have been me.

08:37.170 --> 08:38.260
任务完成了吗
Oh, mission accomplished?

08:38.260 --> 08:40.400
算是用小布什的方式解决了吧
Oh, in a George W. Sort of way.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.400
乔治·沃克·布什  美国第43任总统

08:40.400 --> 08:42.110
这混蛋没法永远待在安全室里
Fucker can't stay in a panic room forever.

08:42.110 --> 08:43.740
你简直过着梦想中的生活  死先生
Oh, you're living the dreams, DP.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.740
这一路都太顺利了  都朋德
It has been quite the run, Dopinder,

08:45.740 --> 08:47.100
谁能想到呢
and who'da thought?

08:47.100 --> 08:49.620
人们提到我的时候就跟提到耶稣似的
Now I'm talked about in the same sentence as Jesus.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.630
《耶稣受难记》第一  接下来就是我
Passion of the Christ, then me.

08:49.630 --> 08:52.840
R级电影中北美票房最高的是《耶稣受难记》
全球票房最高的是《死侍》

08:51.640 --> 08:52.840
至少在国内
At least domestically.

08:52.850 --> 08:54.030
在国外就完全碾压了
We beat them overseas,

08:54.030 --> 08:55.850
毕竟他们根本没有宗教这种东西
where there's no such thing as religion.

08:55.850 --> 08:58.370
我也想过上梦想中的生活  侍侍
I do want to live the dreams, Pool Boy.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.820
开出租车并没有看上去那么性感
Taxiing is not as sexy as it looks.

09:00.830 --> 09:02.740
-我想填充我的...  -口袋吗
- I want to fill my... - Pockets?

09:02.740 --> 09:05.900
你想来点什么  来点可卡因吗
What's your poison? A little, uh, cokey cokey?

09:05.900 --> 09:07.010
不上网点播
Can't maintain an erection

09:07.010 --> 09:08.920
就会早泄吗
without buying shoes online?

09:08.920 --> 09:10.830
这个我可从来没体验过
I've never experienced that last one.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.180
跟我说说  呆子
Talk to me, Goose.

09:12.180 --> 09:15.130
我想说的是"灵魂"  我想填充我的灵魂
I was going to say "Soul". I want to fill my soul.

09:15.130 --> 09:18.170
我想有所归属  就像你  死先生
I want to belong to something, like you, Pool, sir.

09:18.170 --> 09:19.250
都朋德
Dopinder...

09:20.270 --> 09:22.100
你总是能给我带来惊喜
You never cease to surprise me.

09:23.450 --> 09:26.250
你的内心是那么的深邃
You know, the depth of your heart is extraordinary.

09:26.250 --> 09:27.690
我们都需要归属感
We all need a sense of belonging.

09:27.690 --> 09:30.440
我们都需要真切的家的感受
We all need a genuine sense of home.

09:30.450 --> 09:32.480
-在世界上有一个地方  -我想成为一名职业杀手
- A place in this world. - I want to become a contract killer.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.150
不好意思  你说什么
I'm sorry. What did you say?

09:34.150 --> 09:35.770
你还记得我绑架了班度
Remember when I kidnapped Bandhu

09:35.770 --> 09:37.450
然后极度暴力地威胁他吗
and threatened him with great violence?

09:37.450 --> 09:38.850
你差不多算是把他弄死了
You kind of killed him.

09:38.850 --> 09:41.030
你记得《夜访吸血鬼》这部电影吗
And then remember the movie Interview with the Vampire?

09:41.040 --> 09:42.040
不想记得
Don't want to.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.880
当汤姆·克鲁斯给10岁的克尔斯滕·邓斯特
When Tom Cruise fed 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst blood

09:44.880 --> 09:46.660
第一次喂血时
for the first time...

09:46.660 --> 09:48.760
她看着他光滑
and she looked up at his smooth,

09:48.760 --> 09:51.210
帅气的脸庞说...
handsome face and said...

09:51.640 --> 09:53.450
"我还要"
"I want some more."

09:53.450 --> 09:57.370
死先生  把我想象成10岁的克尔斯滕·邓斯特吧
Oh, Pool, picture me, a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.160
我永远不会想不到这一幕了
I'll never not picture that.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.730
但是我真希望我们能尽快
But I can't wait to never speak of this,

10:02.730 --> 10:04.120
永远不要提这件事了
as soon as possible.

10:04.910 --> 10:05.850
我们到了
We're here.

10:14.190 --> 10:15.980
都朋德  还是我
Dopinder, it's me again.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.820
听着  正常人可能会劝你
Look, a saner man might discourage you

10:17.820 --> 10:19.870
不要加入危险的雇佣兵行业
from joining the deadly merc business...

10:19.880 --> 10:21.190
毕竟看看你的小胸膛
what, with your concave chest

10:21.190 --> 10:23.010
和纸板似的小胳膊
and your paper towel tube arms.

10:23.010 --> 10:24.320
但是你是一只雄鹰
But you're an eagle...

10:24.820 --> 10:26.840
该死  雄鹰就该翱翔
and goddamn it, an eagle's gotta soar.

10:26.840 --> 10:27.910
你要把握住这些梦想
You gotta grab those dreams,

10:27.910 --> 10:29.910
抓住梦想的丁丁尖
grab those dreams by the dick tip...

10:29.910 --> 10:31.630
让它喷涌
and make it rain!

10:31.630 --> 10:33.150
我不懂你的意思
I don't know what that means.

10:33.340 --> 10:34.460
我也不懂
Me neither.

10:35.940 --> 10:37.610
那么我们...
I'm gonna see you...

10:38.650 --> 10:40.170
办公室见
at the office.

10:40.790 --> 10:42.000
飞向蓝天
In the sky.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.150
你就是我的汤姆·克鲁斯
You're my Tom Cruise!

10:43.150 --> 10:44.530
你就是我的克里斯滕·邓斯特
And you're my Kristen Dunst!

10:44.530 --> 10:46.120
克里斯滕  克尔斯滕
Kristen? Kirsten?

10:51.270 --> 10:52.440
抱歉  我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

10:52.890 --> 10:54.410
有一群
There was a bunch of

10:54.410 --> 10:56.550
残疾儿童被困在了树上...
handicapable children stuck in a tree...

10:56.550 --> 10:57.670
我得...
and I had to...

10:58.170 --> 11:01.050
你没猜错  我其实在和一个斗篷坏蛋战斗
You're right. I was fighting a caped badass.

10:58.170 --> 11:03.390
《蝙蝠侠大战超人》

11:01.050 --> 11:03.390
但是后来我们发现他的妈妈也叫玛莎
But then we discovered his mom is named Martha, too.

11:03.390 --> 11:05.780
-不行  -被你抓到了
- No. - You got me.

11:05.780 --> 11:07.710
我其实在把世界上所有的面糊搅在一起
I was rounding up all the gluten in the world

11:07.710 --> 11:08.680
然后射向太空
and launching it into space...

11:08.690 --> 11:11.170
让它们再也没法伤害我们了
where it can't not hurt us ever again.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.270
再编像一点
Try again.

11:12.860 --> 11:14.000
腹泻
Diarrhea?

11:14.430 --> 11:15.900
总得等我把这身衣服脱下来才能肯定...
We can't be sure until I get this suit off...

11:15.900 --> 11:19.290
不过所有迹象都表明的确如此
but, uh, all signs point to yes.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.010
堵车
Traffic?

11:24.750 --> 11:26.520
像你很想我一样地亲我  红红
Kiss me like you miss me, Red.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.610
赶紧过来
Well, come here.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.270
我去洗个澡脱掉这身衣服
I'm gonna shower and get out of this suit.

11:41.750 --> 11:42.890
你不想看看你的惊喜吗
Don't you want your surprise?

11:42.890 --> 11:44.620
我看上去像一个烧伤病人吗
Do I look like a patient burn victim?

11:45.430 --> 11:46.970
我也有给你的
I got one for you, too.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.580
周年快乐  宝贝
Happy anniversary, baby.

11:49.580 --> 11:51.120
打开打开打开
Open, open, open.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.600
滑雪球币
Skee-Ball token.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.250
我们第一次约会
Our first date.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.270
没错
Yup.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.820
如假包换  高端铅币
That's genuine, high-grade lead.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.130
我会永远保存的
I'll keep it forever.

12:06.020 --> 12:07.320
谢谢你  宝贝
Thank you, baby.

12:08.950 --> 12:10.800
-打开你的  -好吧  好吧
- Open yours. - All right, all right.

12:12.780 --> 12:16.080
这真是我见过最美的...
That's just the most beautiful thing that I've...

12:16.080 --> 12:17.780
我不知道这是什么玩意
I don't know what this is.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.170
我的IUD[宫内节育器]
My IUD.

12:19.540 --> 12:20.540
炸弹吗
A bomb?

12:20.540 --> 12:23.350
不是  笨蛋  这是我的节育装置
No, dick for brains. My birth control device.

12:23.720 --> 12:24.850
什么  你是说你的...
What, you mean that your...

12:24.860 --> 12:26.810
造娃工厂正式开业
Baby factory's open for business.

12:26.810 --> 12:27.910
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

12:28.830 --> 12:31.480
我的天啊  我要个男孩
Oh, my God! I want a boy!

12:31.480 --> 12:34.180
或者女孩  绝对是这俩的其中一个
Or a little girl! Definitely one or the other!

12:34.530 --> 12:37.620
我还要我们的孩子只有一个名
Oh! And I want our kid to have only one name.

12:37.940 --> 12:40.550
比如雪儿或陶德
Like Cher or Todd.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.150
你得先给我种一颗种子  牛仔小子
You gotta pump a baby in me first, cowboy.

12:43.150 --> 12:44.100
当然了
Yes, I do.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.930
我们先看点小电影  再让床尝尝我们的厉害
Let's watch some porn and show that bed who's boss.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.260
走吧
Let's do that.

12:47.280 --> 12:52.160
犹太爱情音乐电影《燕特尔》

12:48.070 --> 12:52.180
*爸爸  你能听到我吗*
*Papa...Can you hear me*

12:54.030 --> 12:56.670
*爸爸  你能看到我吗*
*Papa, can you see me*

12:56.670 --> 12:58.800
你觉得这首歌耳熟吗
Does this song sound familiar to you?

13:01.120 --> 13:02.110
梅
May.

13:03.490 --> 13:07.240
男孩就叫康纳尔  女孩就叫梅
Connor, if it's a boy. May, if it's a girl.

13:09.810 --> 13:11.180
真奇怪
So weird.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.500
其实本来家庭对我来说算是脏话
Family was always an F-word to me.

13:16.490 --> 13:19.130
我的废物老爹抛弃了我们
My pile of shit father took off and bailed.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.470
我可能没法成为陶德的
I mean, it's not like I have a lot of strong role models

13:22.470 --> 13:24.440
道德榜样
to draw off of for Todd.

13:25.790 --> 13:28.380
看着我
Hey. Look at me.

13:29.670 --> 13:31.830
你不是你父亲
You are not your father.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.810
再说了
Besides...

13:34.810 --> 13:39.790
我绝对不会给我们的孩子起名叫陶德
I will never, ever let our child be named Todd.

13:40.710 --> 13:41.260
但是事实上
But here's the thing,

13:41.260 --> 13:43.100
事情不都会是那种走向吗
isn't that how it always works?

13:43.710 --> 13:45.150
就像在《星球大战》里
Like in Star Wars,

13:45.160 --> 13:47.400
男性总会变得跟自己父亲一样
men are destined to become their father...

13:48.060 --> 13:50.640
然后再和自己的姐妹自愿发生性关系
and then have consensual sex with their sister?

13:51.120 --> 13:53.600
我觉得你应该漏掉了很大一部分重要剧情
I think you missed big, big chunks of that movie.

13:54.350 --> 13:56.790
不  卢克肯定上了她
No, I'm pretty sure Luke nailed her.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.190
宝贝  那是《帝国反击战》里的
Baby, that's Empire.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.370
最重要的是  孩子们
The point is, kids...

14:02.970 --> 14:05.390
给我们一个机会变得更好
they give us a chance to be better than we are.

14:06.370 --> 14:07.800
变得比我们以前更好
Better than we used to be.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.760
你比我看上去聪明多了
You're a lot smarter than I look.

14:12.730 --> 14:14.430
我去做甜点
I'm gonna go make dessert.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.570
你先绑上束带  我们来造一个超级宝宝
You get the strap-on. Let's make a super baby.

14:18.970 --> 14:21.120
宝宝肯定不是那样就能造的  不过我们能试试
Pretty sure it doesn't work that way, but we can try.

14:22.420 --> 14:25.650
克里斯托呢  克开头的
What about Krystal? But with a "K"?

14:26.080 --> 14:27.300
太像脱衣舞男了
It's too stripper-y.

14:27.830 --> 14:29.540
凯开头的凯文
Kevin with a "K"!

14:29.540 --> 14:31.980
不行  也太像脱衣舞男了
No, too stripper-y, too.

14:31.980 --> 14:33.160
厄尔
Uh, Earl!

14:33.940 --> 14:36.330
如果我们给他起名叫厄尔
He's gonna go straight to jail

14:36.330 --> 14:38.740
他会直接进监狱
if we name him Earl.

14:38.740 --> 14:41.890
布鲁斯呢
What about Bruce?

14:41.890 --> 14:43.010
不
No.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.040
-趴下  -怎么了
- Get down. - What?

15:14.250 --> 15:16.440
宝贝  宝贝
Baby? Baby?

15:19.690 --> 15:20.740
我没事
I'm okay.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.910
谢天谢地我没用上那个奶油干酪磨碎机
Thank God I didn't have to use the cream cheese spreader.

15:58.610 --> 16:00.020
不要
Please.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.570
不要  不要
Please. Please.

16:06.570 --> 16:10.270
宝贝  对不起
Baby, I'm so sorry.

16:10.270 --> 16:14.040
不
No!

18:01.390 --> 18:04.970
出品
等一下

18:10.730 --> 18:14.650
制片
你刚杀了她吗

18:16.030 --> 18:19.950
监制
我操

18:24.160 --> 18:28.120
美术设计
她简直是大家最爱的角色

18:29.870 --> 18:33.840
剪辑
我回来了  祝你们好运  混蛋

18:41.640 --> 18:45.600
主演
显然雷诺兹不想与人共享聚光灯

18:47.390 --> 18:51.270
编剧
都怪编剧
去你妈的"真英雄"

18:55.900 --> 19:00.030
摄影
真的会拍摄的家伙

19:02.780 --> 19:08.500
导演
在《疾速追杀》里杀死那只狗的家伙之一

19:18.240 --> 19:21.290
*爸爸  你能听到我吗*
*Papa, can you hear me*

19:22.260 --> 19:23.730
只有我觉得
Is it just me, or does

19:23.730 --> 19:25.390
《冰雪奇缘》的插曲《你想堆雪人吗》
Do You Want to Build a Snowman? From Frozen...

19:25.390 --> 19:26.750
听起来特别像
sound suspiciously like

19:26.750 --> 19:29.100
《燕特尔》里的《爸爸  你能听到我吗》
Papa, Can You Hear Me? From Yentl?

19:30.090 --> 19:32.070
*爸爸  你能听到我吗*
*Papa, can you hear me*

19:34.320 --> 19:36.470
而根本没有人注意到
And nobody fucking realizes it.

19:36.830 --> 19:38.420
韦德  你该回家了
Wade, you gotta go home.

19:38.420 --> 19:41.070
你已经在这里坐了三天
You've been sitting here for three days, okay?

19:41.070 --> 19:44.410
你闻起来像湿热雨季扔在外面的酸菜
You smell like sauerkraut left in the warm rain.

19:44.410 --> 19:47.410
泡在新鲜热尿中的垃圾
Like wet garbage in hot urine.

19:47.410 --> 19:49.370
你闻起来像一只吃饱了用过的猫砂...
You smell like a dog ate kitty litter...

19:49.370 --> 19:51.340
然后在客厅里一路放屁的狗
and then farted his way out of the living room.

19:51.340 --> 19:53.270
就像拉什·林博
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's

19:53.270 --> 19:55.210
拍完《鲨鱼周》后坐的沙发垫
couch cushions after Shark Week.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.440
我爱《冰雪奇缘》
I love Frozen.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.310
我爱她  我爱她就像海洋爱着水
I loved her. I loved her like an ocean loves water.

20:00.680 --> 20:01.930
海洋就是水
An ocean is water.

20:01.930 --> 20:06.270
更重要的是  我喜欢她  我真的很喜欢她
More importantly, I liked her. I really liked her, you know?

20:06.900 --> 20:07.740
乔治·迈克尔唱得对
George Michael was right.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.140
威猛先生乐队  《无心快语》

20:07.740 --> 20:10.150
我再也不会跳舞了  操
I'm never gonna dance again. Fuck!

20:10.680 --> 20:11.850
他也死了
He's dead, too.

20:13.050 --> 20:14.220
至少我们还有鲍威
At least we still have Bowie.

20:14.220 --> 20:16.290
死先生  大卫·鲍威...
Oh, Mr. Pool. David Bowie is...

20:17.200 --> 20:18.500
还活着
still with us.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.270
卒于2016年

20:18.500 --> 20:21.270
没错  我们还有鲍威
We do. We'll always have Bowie.

20:22.140 --> 20:23.170
对不起
I'm sorry.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.180
一杯接一杯
Shot after shot,

20:24.180 --> 20:26.590
这也改变不了事实  我觉得你就是...
it's not gonna change the fact that I think you're...

20:26.590 --> 20:28.170
你在尿尿吗  你正在撒尿吗
Are you pissing? Are you urinating right now?

20:28.170 --> 20:30.370
你在做出你尿尿时的表情
You're making the face that you make when you urinate.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.610
-他在尿尿吗  -我来
- Is he pissing? - I'm on it!

20:32.960 --> 20:34.120
很好  都朋德
There you go, Dopinder.

20:34.380 --> 20:35.650
如果你想成为职业杀手
If you want to be a contract killer...

20:35.650 --> 20:38.670
耍枪之前  必须要先耍拖吧
you gotta handle a mop before you handle a gun.

20:38.670 --> 20:39.760
只不过我并不明白
Although I don't quite understand

20:39.760 --> 20:41.270
他们有什么相似的地方
how they are at all similar.

20:41.270 --> 20:43.690
因为我都能把它们插进你的屁眼里杀了你
'Cause I could shove either one up your ass and kill you.

20:43.690 --> 20:44.720
滚吧
Now, leave me.

20:45.020 --> 20:45.990
我懂了
I get it.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.450
回家吧  韦德
Go home, Wade.

20:48.030 --> 20:50.950
我没有家了  黄鼠狼  你懂的  我...
I don't have a home, Weas, you know. I got a...

20:51.680 --> 20:54.230
我没事  我没事
Okay, I'm fine. I'm fine.

20:54.230 --> 20:56.180
你知道"没事"是什么意思吗  韦德
You know what "Fine" stands for, Wade?

20:56.180 --> 20:59.450
操蛋  混乱  贫穷和崩溃
Fucked up, insecure, needy, and emotional.

20:59.930 --> 21:01.150
根据...
According to the...

21:02.940 --> 21:04.280
-库布勒-罗斯  -没错
- Kübler-Ross. - Yeah.

21:02.940 --> 21:05.860
伊丽莎白·库布勒-罗斯理论
描述了人对待哀伤与灾难过程中的五个独立阶段

21:04.280 --> 21:05.860
根据库布勒-罗斯理论
According to the Kübler-Ross model...

21:05.850 --> 21:09.000
否认  愤怒  讨价还价  抑郁  接受

21:05.850 --> 21:09.000
否认只是五个阶段中其中一个
denial is just one of the five stages of grief.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.870
天啊  巴克
Jesus Christ, Buck!

21:11.410 --> 21:13.330
瑞安·雷诺兹是本片编剧之一

21:11.410 --> 21:13.330
还是别给你安排台词了
No more speaking lines for you.

21:21.790 --> 21:23.960
伙计  伙计
Hey, bud. Bud.

21:24.810 --> 21:25.820
有火柴吗
Got a match?

21:26.340 --> 21:27.350
火柴
Match?

21:27.850 --> 21:28.910
有  我手上就有
Yes, I have one right here.

21:28.910 --> 21:31.030
别动  抢劫
Don't make a move. This is a stick-up.

21:31.030 --> 21:32.550
-什么  -听到了吗
- What? - You heard me.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.650
先生  先生  放下枪
Mister, Mister, put down that gun.

21:34.650 --> 21:38.030
闭嘴  快点  要钱要命
Shut up. Now, come on. Your money or your life?

21:35.180 --> 21:35.890
韦德的海洛因

21:45.470 --> 21:49.470
-伙计  -我说"要钱要命"
- Look, bud. - I said, "Your money or your life."

21:49.470 --> 21:50.630
"我在考虑"
"I'm thinking it over!"

21:50.630 --> 21:52.270
我操
Motherfuck!

21:52.460 --> 21:53.390
操
Fuck!

21:56.170 --> 21:57.830
你来这里干什么
The hell you doin' here?

21:57.840 --> 21:59.800
你不知道怎么敲门吗
Don't you know how to knock?

21:59.800 --> 22:01.830
我以为通过你的耳朵
I thought you saw me...

22:01.830 --> 22:03.140
看到我了
with your ears.

22:03.410 --> 22:04.900
算你走运  我没有一枪...
You're lucky I didn't shoot you in the...

22:04.900 --> 22:05.710
打到墙上
The wall?

22:05.710 --> 22:08.990
打到冰箱上  我太痛苦了
The refrigerator? I'm in so much pain.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.340
我听说了  亲爱的
I heard the news, sweetie.

22:13.490 --> 22:15.200
我很遗憾  真的
I'm very sorry. I am.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.620
我该怎么做  艾尔
What am I gonna do, Al?

22:17.620 --> 22:19.430
可能要做些很可怕的事
Probably something terrible.

22:20.510 --> 22:21.710
以你的风格
Knowing you.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.280
都是我的错
It was my fault.

22:24.730 --> 22:26.180
都是我干的
I fucking did this.

22:27.460 --> 22:29.190
我只想抓住她  看着她
And all I wanna do is grab her and see her

22:29.190 --> 22:31.250
告诉她我很抱歉  而我做不到
and tell her that I'm sorry, and I can't.

22:33.330 --> 22:34.550
她死了
She's gone.

22:35.070 --> 22:38.900
亲爱的  你能大声点吗
Sweetheart, can you speak up?

22:38.900 --> 22:39.890
你嘴里含着屌
It's a little hard to hear you

22:39.890 --> 22:41.890
说话听不到
with that pity dick in your mouth.

22:41.890 --> 22:45.100
听着  亲爱的  你得好好活下去
Now, look, sugar. You need to just keep living.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.050
谢谢你
Thank you...

22:46.050 --> 22:49.090
马修·麦康纳  你说的话太有用了
Matthew McConaughey, your words are a treasure.

22:46.050 --> 22:49.090
马修·麦康纳创立了一个叫"好好活下去"的慈善基金

22:49.080 --> 22:50.800
聆听你的痛苦
Listen to the pain.

22:51.140 --> 22:54.260
既能让你知往事  也能让你明来者
It's both history teacher and fortune teller.

22:54.260 --> 22:57.120
痛苦教会了我们怎么做自己  韦德
Pain teaches us who we are, Wade.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.950
有时候因为太痛苦  感觉像是要死去了一般
Sometimes, it's so bad, we feel like we're dying.

23:01.860 --> 23:04.700
但是没有经历过死亡怎么能算活过呢  对吧
But we can't really live till we've died a little, can we?

23:07.140 --> 23:08.090
韦德
Wade?

23:10.610 --> 23:12.460
-韦德  -我在呢  艾尔西亚
- Wade? - I'm right here, Althea.

23:12.970 --> 23:14.890
这是我听过
And that is the most beautiful thing

23:15.560 --> 23:16.790
最动人的话
I've ever heard.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.130
你说得没错
And you're absolutely right.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.250
我要做一些很可怕的事
I'm about to do something terrible.

23:27.210 --> 23:30.470
北极熊
我们的名字是维克多和汉克

23:31.300 --> 23:32.560
他们很珍贵吧
Precious, aren't they?

23:34.790 --> 23:36.290
你是超级英雄吗
Are you a superhero?

23:36.290 --> 23:37.720
回答非常正确  亲爱的
Fucking A, sweetie.

23:37.990 --> 23:39.730
你叫什么
What's your name?

23:39.730 --> 23:41.670
美味裤裤队长
Captain Delicious Pants.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.010
美味裤裤队长是谁
Who's Captain Delicious Pants?

23:41.980 --> 23:46.190
不要给北极熊喂食

23:52.200 --> 23:55.300
疏通剂

24:09.160 --> 24:11.050
真不敢相信他还活着
I can't believe he's still alive.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.550
真不敢相信你穿着这一身就出门了
I can't believe you left the house in that shirt.

24:15.030 --> 24:16.860
肯定有办法能死亡
There's gotta be some way to die.

24:17.140 --> 24:19.290
我只是需要更努力地死亡
I just need to die harder.

24:19.290 --> 24:20.560
福克斯影业
Trademark Fox.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.660
赶上进度了吧
Y'all caught up now?

24:39.470 --> 24:41.830
咱俩一样疯狂
Your crazy matches my crazy.

24:41.830 --> 24:44.560
我绝对不会给我们的孩子起名叫陶德
I will never, ever let our child be named Todd.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.360

妮莎
Ness?

25:03.230 --> 25:04.160
妮莎
Ness.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.490
妮莎  有点不对劲  我没法靠近你
Ness, there's something here. I can't get to you.

25:09.110 --> 25:11.120
你的心没放对地方
Your heart's not in the right place.

25:11.620 --> 25:13.580
等等  什么
Wait, hold on. What?

25:13.490 --> 25:16.360
我爱你  韦德·威尔逊

25:14.470 --> 25:16.100
你的心没放对地方
Your heart's not in the right place.

25:16.100 --> 25:19.190
等等  什么叫我的心没放对地方  你...
Wait. What do you mean my heart's not in the right place? What does it...

25:38.930 --> 25:41.180
我真的为你的遭遇感到遗憾  韦德
I'm terribly sorry for your loss, Wade.

25:41.570 --> 25:42.820
你已经碎[心碎]了
You're broken.

25:43.140 --> 25:46.250
天啊  我认得这声音
Oh, God. I know that voice.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.690
艾瑟斯大宅
变异康复机构
布罗德斯通孤儿院

26:07.310 --> 26:08.540
罗素
Well, Russell.

26:08.740 --> 26:11.710
我听说你很擅长开锁
I hear you're handy at picking locks.

26:12.750 --> 26:14.570
这里不需要这项技能
There will be no need for that here.

26:15.050 --> 26:18.510
我们的门上没有锁  我们的窗户上没有栏杆
There's no locks on our doors, no bars on our windows.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.140
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

26:21.650 --> 26:23.650
那些孩子为什么不直接逃跑呢
Why don't the kids just run?

26:24.480 --> 26:26.960
谁会选择留在这种地方
Who would choose to stay in such a place?

26:27.620 --> 26:29.430
你留下  是因为...
You stay because...

26:29.960 --> 26:34.850
内心深处  你知道你不适合离开这里
deep down inside, you know you're unfit to leave.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.750
别担心
Don't worry.

26:41.260 --> 26:42.630
我们能
We can fix that.

26:47.920 --> 26:51.480
赐福于那些被我所治愈的邪恶之人
Blessed are the wicked who are healed by my hand.

27:13.620 --> 27:15.510
"心放对地方"
"Heart's in the right place."

27:15.510 --> 27:16.630
"心放对..."  到底是什么意思
"Heart's in the right..." What does that mean?

27:16.630 --> 27:18.720
脱掉面具  韦德
Take your mask off, Wade.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.420
真希望你说的是"裤子"
I wish you'd said "Pants".

27:20.420 --> 27:21.820
我们来玩个游戏吧
Let's play a game.

27:21.820 --> 27:24.150
名字叫"阿德里安·布劳迪还是亚当·布罗迪"
It's called "Adrien Brody or Adam Brody?".

27:24.150 --> 27:26.710
来  闭上眼睛  张开嘴巴
Now, close your eyes and open your mouth.

27:26.710 --> 27:28.970
你在这里不需要耍宝
You don't need to be funny here.

27:28.970 --> 27:30.210
我们必须谈谈
We must talk.

27:30.210 --> 27:32.050
你需要一个新的开始
You need fresh start.

27:32.890 --> 27:34.210
如此耀眼的阳光
Such a glare.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.560
我仿佛正站在盖伊提剧院的舞台上
It's like I'm on stage at the Gaiety.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.530
通过训练  你可以成为一名X战警
With training, you can be X-Man.

27:39.530 --> 27:41.560
你在浪费你自己的时间  闪亮耶稣
You're wasting your time, Shiny Jesus.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.910
我不是当X战警的料
I'm not X-Man material.

27:42.910 --> 27:44.580
你真是本年度低调之最
Understatement of the year.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.510
韦德  这是雪绪
Wade, Yukio.

27:46.520 --> 27:47.870
雪绪  这是韦德
Yukio, Wade.

27:47.870 --> 27:50.580
这他妈是什么情况
What in the fuck knuckles is this?

27:50.580 --> 27:52.370
她是我的女朋友  你这个混蛋
She's my girlfriend, you intolerant shit.

27:52.370 --> 27:55.090
别这么冲嘛  福克斯新闻播报员
Whoa! Pump the hate brakes, Fox & Friends.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.020
我只是很惊讶竟然有人愿意和你交往
I'm just surprised anyone would date you.

27:57.030 --> 27:59.500
特别是《小马宝莉》里的粉红派
Especially Pinkie Pie from My Little Pony.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.250
我喜欢这家伙
I like this guy.

28:01.760 --> 28:02.930
再给他个机会
Give him a chance.

28:03.780 --> 28:05.260
看见你这样真好
It's great seeing you like this.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.510
再见  韦德
Bye, Wade!

28:08.510 --> 28:11.280
在我们这里有几条基本规则
Now, some ground rules while under our roof.

28:11.280 --> 28:14.270
"第一条  不准杀人..."
"Rule number one. No killing...

28:14.280 --> 28:17.640
"任何人  都不行  不管有多坏"
"Anyone ever, no matter how bad.

28:17.640 --> 28:20.780
"第二条  冰箱里的所有东西都要加标签"
"Rule two. Label everything in refrigerator."

28:20.780 --> 28:21.680
韦德
Wade?

28:22.420 --> 28:23.340
韦德
Wade?

28:23.550 --> 28:25.430
坐上了X教授的轮椅

28:23.550 --> 28:25.430
-别想追我  -韦德
- Don't try to chase me. - Wade!

28:25.440 --> 28:27.010
我还没做好再次被摸的准备呢
I'm not ready to be touched again.

28:27.410 --> 28:29.520
墙上挂着好多老头的照片
All these old guys on the wall.

28:29.850 --> 28:31.980
谁住在这里  卡莉斯塔·弗洛克哈特吗
Who lives here, Calista Flockhart?

28:29.850 --> 28:31.980
她的丈夫比她大22岁

28:34.040 --> 28:36.700
这些雕像摔下来时已经坏了
Those were already damaged after they fell there!

28:37.300 --> 28:39.000
我到底应该在这里干什么
What am I supposed to do around here, anyway?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.350
坐成一圈  分享我的感受吗
Sit in a share circle, talk about my feelings?

28:41.350 --> 28:43.130
那我到底该怎么做
And how would I do that exactly?

28:43.130 --> 28:46.870
因为  其他人都他妈去哪里了
'Cause where the fuck is everyone?

28:46.880 --> 28:47.940
每次都只有你
It's always just you

28:47.940 --> 28:50.010
还有那个名字奇长无比的负少...
and Negasonic Teenage Longest Name Ever...

28:50.010 --> 28:50.980
够了
Enough!

28:51.410 --> 28:52.700
我说了不准摸我
I said no touching!

28:54.170 --> 28:56.980
搞什么
What the fuck?

28:57.630 --> 28:59.900
还以为制片人会给我们点甜头呢
You'd think the studio would throw us a bone.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.930
稍微有点味道的那种
One that doesn't end up in my mouth.

29:02.610 --> 29:03.970
第一部赚的钱
The first movie made more money

29:03.970 --> 29:06.360
比发明裤子的人赚的都多
than the guy who invented pants.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.600
连一位像样点的X战警都请不出来吗
They can't just dust off one of the famous X-Men?

29:08.600 --> 29:10.860
那个背上长着巨大企鹅翅膀的小子呢
How 'bout that putz with the giant pigeon wings?

29:10.860 --> 29:12.020
那翅膀到底是干什么的
What do those do anyway, huh?

29:12.020 --> 29:13.150
能让他离地个几厘米
Carry him three feet off the ground

29:13.150 --> 29:15.730
拿到最近的松饼屑吗
to snatch up the nearest muffin crumb?

29:15.730 --> 29:17.830
不不不
No, no, no, no, no. No!

29:17.830 --> 29:20.680
我根本不是当X战警的料
I am not X-Man material at all.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.700
首先
First off...

29:23.310 --> 29:25.640
我都不是处男  第二...
I'm not even a virgin. Second and more...

29:27.380 --> 29:28.240
我就应该
I should have left you

29:28.240 --> 29:30.710
让你继续跟我找到你时一样自怨自艾
in the self-pitying mess I found you in.

29:30.710 --> 29:33.600
但是这是朋友该做的事  在需要时出现
But this is what friends do. They show up!

29:33.600 --> 29:35.650
并不是锦上添花
Not when convenient or easy.

29:35.650 --> 29:39.420
而是雪中送炭  而你总会让雪下得更大
When hard, and you always make it hard.

29:39.970 --> 29:42.430
你很不好
You are unwell.

29:42.430 --> 29:44.790
我带你回来可是冒了很大的险
I'm sticking my neck out bringing you here.

29:44.790 --> 29:48.220
等等  有一个杀害凡妮莎的混蛋跑了
Wait. One of the assholes who killed Vanessa got away.

29:50.570 --> 29:52.850
上帝啊
Oh, Jesus Christ!

29:52.850 --> 29:55.010
我刚刚有一瞬间还以为你要亲我呢
I thought you were gonna kiss me for a second there.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.750
如果你真的要亲  我也是拦不住你的
Please know I wouldn't be able to stop you if you did.

29:56.750 --> 29:58.820
韦德  不管他们是谁...
Wade, whoever they are...

29:58.830 --> 30:01.760
我们都要抓住他们  带他们伏法
we track them down and bring them to justice.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.890
是我
It was me.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.850
逃走的那个混蛋是我
I'm the asshole who got away.

30:08.720 --> 30:11.080
我把他们都杀了  除了我
I killed every last one of them, except me.

30:11.860 --> 30:13.040
杀不死我
Couldn't kill me.

30:16.810 --> 30:18.590
我们本来准备组建一个家庭
We were gonna start a family.

30:20.720 --> 30:21.800
我们...
We were, uh...

30:23.710 --> 30:25.360
我们本来要成为一家人
We were gonna be a family.

30:26.370 --> 30:27.220
韦德
Wade...

30:27.490 --> 30:30.920
凡妮莎已经死了  她不会回来了
Vanessa is gone. She's not coming back.

30:31.770 --> 30:34.180
这里可能不是你理想中的家庭
This may not be family you want...

30:34.180 --> 30:36.060
但是你需要这个家庭
but it's family you need.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.940
你有一颗善良的心
You have a good heart.

30:37.940 --> 30:40.320
在这里才能让它成长
It belongs here where it can grow.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.430
你说什么
What did you say?

30:44.540 --> 30:45.770
关于我的心
About my heart?

30:51.320 --> 30:53.030
我觉得我来对地方了
I think I'm in the right place.

32:00.940 --> 32:04.300
我来告诉你最大的谎言
I'mma tell you what the big lie is.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.360
此处马特·达蒙客串

32:04.310 --> 32:05.360
厕纸
Toilet paper.

32:05.460 --> 32:06.960
厕纸有什么问题
What's so bad about toilet paper?

32:06.960 --> 32:08.460
能全擦干净
Gets the job done.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.090
真的能全擦干净吗
Does it really get the job done?

32:11.090 --> 32:13.140
好吧  假设你明早醒来
All right. Say you wake up tomorrow morning...

32:13.140 --> 32:18.120
假设  发现你的脸上有一些新鲜的屎
and, hypothetically, find some fresh shit on your face.

32:18.130 --> 32:20.040
你的脸颊上  可能胡子上也有一些
Your cheek, maybe a little bit in the beard.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.290
搞什么  说得我都恶心了
What the hell? I'm about to be fucking sick!

32:21.290 --> 32:22.610
你怎么办
What do you do?

32:22.610 --> 32:23.510
你会去厕所
Do you go to a bathroom

32:23.510 --> 32:25.450
撕下一些干纸巾
and tear off a piece of dry tissue...

32:25.450 --> 32:27.220
在你的胡子上擦两下
and rub it around on your beard a little bit

32:27.220 --> 32:29.230
然后继续开始这一天的生活吗
and then go on, get on with your day?

32:29.230 --> 32:30.840
去教堂  也许去参加晚宴  看电影
Go to church, maybe dinner and a movie,

32:30.840 --> 32:32.090
好像无事发生过
like nothing happened?

32:32.090 --> 32:33.280
你到底要说什么  伙计
Where is this coming from, man?

32:33.280 --> 32:34.110
但其实还是发生了些什么
But something did happen.

32:34.110 --> 32:36.270
你的脸闻上去一股屎味  对吗
Your face smells like shit. Right?

32:36.270 --> 32:37.510
所以其实你会做的是
So what you would do,

32:37.510 --> 32:40.310
拿点肥皂  搞点热水
is you would get some soap, you'd get some hot water...

32:40.310 --> 32:42.540
然后狠狠地擦你的胡子
and you would scrub the fucking shit

32:42.550 --> 32:44.630
洗上个十来遍
out of your beard for 10 straight minutes.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.250
-怎么擦都觉得不够  -你是想
- You could not scrub it enough. - Are you trying to

32:46.250 --> 32:47.760
恶心我吗
make me feel disgusting?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.010
我开始觉得...
I'm starting to feel...

32:49.010 --> 32:51.930
厕纸算是很不错的前菜
Toilet paper is a pretty fine appetizer.

32:51.930 --> 32:53.150
但是然后...
But, then...

32:54.500 --> 32:56.860
哈吉斯自然呵护湿巾
Huggies Natural Care wet wipes.

32:56.860 --> 32:58.320
这才是主菜
That's your main course.

32:58.330 --> 33:01.670
柔软  湿润  婴儿专用
They're soft, they're moist. They're for babies.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.030
最后再用一张纸巾
Finally, one more pass with toilet paper,

33:05.030 --> 33:07.050
擦掉残余的水分
maybe clear out that excess moisture.

33:07.050 --> 33:08.490
如果你能找到吹风机的话
Maybe treat yourself to a blow and go,

33:08.490 --> 33:09.970
还能给自己做个头发
if you can get you a hair dryer.

33:09.970 --> 33:12.140
只要30秒就行
Just about 30 seconds would do you good.

33:16.190 --> 33:17.190
搞什么
The fuck?

33:18.320 --> 33:19.380
年
Year.

33:20.390 --> 33:21.290
什么
What?

33:22.560 --> 33:24.000
现在是哪一年
What year is it?

33:24.380 --> 33:26.870
这他妈是什么傻逼问题
What kind of dumbass question is that to ask?

33:57.630 --> 33:59.990
我们接下来要参加为期八周的训练
We have 8 weeks of boot camp ahead of us, men.

33:59.990 --> 34:01.660
通过训练  我们能做好应付
That'll get us toned and prepared

34:01.660 --> 34:03.340
各种战斗的准备
for all manner of combat.

34:05.500 --> 34:09.410
这绝对不行
Not working out at all.

34:09.750 --> 34:10.970
胶带
Masking tape.

34:11.450 --> 34:13.850
不是冷却铝制品的好朋友
It is no friend to chilled aluminum.

34:14.910 --> 34:16.600
尼龙搭扣  颜色分类  效率高
Velcro. Color-coded, efficient,

34:16.600 --> 34:18.250
有助于保护环境
environmentally friendly.

34:18.860 --> 34:20.450
他在和谁说话
Who is he talking to?

34:20.450 --> 34:22.170
他为什么穿得像个注册性侵者
And why is he dressed like a registered sex offender?

34:22.170 --> 34:23.870
你们能集中注意力吗  女士们
Can we focus for a moment, ladies?

34:23.880 --> 34:26.070
拜托  我们得谈谈下个月的饮食计划
Please, we need to talk about next month's meal plan.

34:26.070 --> 34:27.940
显然大家都很讨厌酸橘汁腌鱼
Obviously, everyone hated the ceviche.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.710
我看了建议箱
I read the suggestion box.

34:29.710 --> 34:31.060
我还是先打断你吧
I'm gonna stop you right there.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.480
你的演技太拙劣了
I see through this weak act.

34:33.480 --> 34:37.820
也许你能装好人骗过钢力士
You may have fooled Colossus with this nice guy shit...

34:37.820 --> 34:38.970
但你骗不过我
but not me.

34:38.970 --> 34:40.040
态度好一点
Don't be mean.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.530
别多嘴  NTW
Back off, NTW.

34:41.530 --> 34:43.770
不不不  让她说
No, no, no. Let her go.

34:44.000 --> 34:44.850
让她说  没关系
Let her go, it's okay.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.630
她有权力进行怀疑
She has a right to be skeptical.

34:46.630 --> 34:49.790
看着我  我就是活靶子
Look at me. I'm an easy target.

34:50.420 --> 34:51.330
历史上来说
You know, historically,

34:51.330 --> 34:53.810
我一直就是恶作剧的代名词
mischief has been my mistress...

34:53.810 --> 34:56.480
所以我明白  但是我更希望认为...
so I understand, you know. But I like to think...

34:58.200 --> 35:00.110
你们真的感染了我
that you guys have really rubbed off on me.

35:01.450 --> 35:03.980
我希望认为我也感染了你们
I like to think that I've rubbed off around you, too.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.500
很多
A lot.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.730
很久以来的第一次
And for the first time in a long while...

35:10.310 --> 35:11.480
我喜欢我自己
I like me.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.990
-我接受你的道歉  -我没有道歉
- I accept your apology. - I never apologized.

35:15.990 --> 35:17.710
我在和你的内心对话
I was talking to your heart.

35:17.710 --> 35:20.320
看  你并没有迷失在你自己过往的想法中
See? You're not lost cause you thought.

35:20.320 --> 35:23.530
我很自豪  我就知道你绝对不会让我失望
I'm proud. You're everything I knew you can be.

35:23.530 --> 35:24.930
谢谢你  钢力士
Thank you, Colossus.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.150
我只是想成为这世界上最好的X战警[男人]
Just trying to be the world's best X-Man.

35:27.150 --> 35:28.810
抱歉  是X人
Sorry, X-Person.

35:30.810 --> 35:33.050
洗洁精有点不对劲
Something wrong with the soap.

35:33.050 --> 35:34.010
没事
It's fine.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.830
我刚灌满  多按几下
I just filled it. Give it a few more pumps there.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.150
现在  不好意思
Now, if you'll excuse me...

35:40.610 --> 35:42.110
现在正是清灰[兔子]季节
it's dust bunny season...

35:42.460 --> 35:44.100
我要去猎兔子了

35:44.100 --> 35:45.240
再见  韦德
Bye, Wade!

35:47.130 --> 35:50.030
-操  -操你
- Fuck. - Fuck you.

36:01.690 --> 36:03.790
没人生下来就是完美的
No one is born perfect.

36:04.470 --> 36:05.650
但你们可以努力
But you can be.

36:06.410 --> 36:08.850
我知道你们在做生来就会做的事
I know you're doing what comes naturally.

36:13.030 --> 36:14.890
你们控制不了自己
You can't help yourself.

36:18.750 --> 36:20.010
但你可以努力
But you can.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.530
你们需要努力  控制
It takes work, discipline...

36:23.960 --> 36:25.050
和治疗
and treatment.

36:25.330 --> 36:27.040
你们的能力
Your abilities...

36:27.030 --> 36:30.700
要人类  不要变种人

36:28.660 --> 36:30.930
我知道那有多么诱人
I know how seductive they are.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.850
让你感觉自己有多强大
How powerful they make you feel.

36:34.330 --> 36:36.960
但你必须学会如何利用它们
But you must learn never to use them...

36:37.300 --> 36:40.050
这样它们才不会利用你
so they will never use you.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.470
不要哭
Please don't cry.

36:48.710 --> 36:49.740
我会帮你
I'm going to help.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.860
我会让你每次想要随意使用你的能力时
I'm gonna make you feel what you should feel.

36:53.460 --> 36:55.040
都会感受到
How you need to feel...

36:55.970 --> 36:59.510
你应有的感受  你需要的感受
every time you're tempted to act upon your urges.

36:59.510 --> 37:03.280
吸我变种人屌吧  你这个四眼混蛋
Suck my mutant dick, you four-eyed fuck.

37:17.650 --> 37:18.560
韦德
Wade.

37:20.300 --> 37:21.210
韦德

37:21.660 --> 37:23.780
请进  我只是在
Come in! Hey, I was just doing

37:23.780 --> 37:25.480
读一些闲书

我们有任务了
We have mission.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.820
那你们要注意安全

37:28.820 --> 37:30.060
我会为你们祈祷的

37:30.060 --> 37:32.330
不  我希望你加入我们
No, I want you to join.

37:33.600 --> 37:34.870
不好意思  你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

37:34.870 --> 37:36.490
你都听到了
You heard me.

37:36.490 --> 37:38.850
相信我  这是个糟糕的主意
Trust me, that's a terrible idea.

37:38.850 --> 37:40.200
我根本没准备好
I'm really not ready.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.710
-你准备好了  -我没有
- You are ready. - I'm not.

37:41.950 --> 37:43.770
五分钟后上X战机
Be at the X-Jet in five.

37:43.770 --> 37:45.020
我能做30分钟
I can do thirty.

37:45.020 --> 37:47.040
-现在就去  -我现在也能做
- Now. - I can do now.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.130
最终报价
Final offer.

37:48.130 --> 37:50.710
艾琳·梅利韦瑟  威特新闻
Irene Merryweather, WHIT News.

37:48.660 --> 37:56.370
变种人事故

37:50.710 --> 37:52.610
正在从变异康复机构
Live here at a breaking news situation

37:52.610 --> 37:55.540
艾瑟斯大宅发回突发新闻现场报道
at the Essex House for Mutant Rehabilitation.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.810
一名变异人男孩引发了一起事故
A mutant boy is appearing to have some sort of an incident...

37:58.820 --> 38:00.500
-警察正在我身后  -离我远一点
- with police here behind me. - Get away from me!

38:00.510 --> 38:03.560
两辆警察被其掀翻
There are two police vehicles that are overturned.

38:03.560 --> 38:04.580

38:04.580 --> 38:06.830
现场一片混乱
A scene of absolute chaos here.

38:06.830 --> 38:09.460
我要烧死你们  给我后退
I'll burn you! You stay back!

38:10.210 --> 38:11.740
给我后退
Get away from me!

38:11.990 --> 38:13.600
你们想死吗
You wanna fucking die?

38:29.020 --> 38:32.660
X战警到达了现场...
And it appears as if the X-Men are arriving...

38:32.670 --> 38:35.790
-散开  -好像还带了一名实习生
- Scatter! - ...with what appears to be a trainee.

38:36.170 --> 38:39.170
所有人冷静点  专家来了  我...
Everyone, calm down! The pros are here. I...

38:39.500 --> 38:40.750
我们是X战警
We're the X-Men!

38:40.750 --> 38:40.750
X战警的创作初衷确实和倡导种族平权有关

38:40.750 --> 38:43.370
60年代种族歧视的过时隐喻
A dated metaphor for racism in the '60s.

38:43.370 --> 38:45.380
所以  敬你
So, respect.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.270
稍息  警官
At ease, Officer.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.870
你在干什么
What are you doing?

38:50.490 --> 38:51.900
我的职责
My job!

38:51.900 --> 38:53.060
是你说我准备好了
You're the one who said I was ready,

38:53.060 --> 38:54.860
我明明对你进行了反驳
and I frankly disagreed with you.

38:54.860 --> 38:57.290
但我们还是来了  力图摒弃我们的嫌隙
But here we are, trying to overcome our differences.

38:57.290 --> 39:00.070
就像碧昂丝说过  "拜托...
Like Beyonce says, "Please...

39:00.620 --> 39:02.410
"拜托  不要再骗我了"
"Please, stop cheating on me."

39:03.280 --> 39:04.720
这已经是第五起事故了
This is the fifth incident.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.870
这孩子必须得进冰盒  不能待在这里
This kid needs to be in the Ice Box, not here.

39:06.870 --> 39:08.670
罗素归我们照看
Russell belongs in our care.

39:08.670 --> 39:10.500
不能进监狱  我保证...
Not in prison. I assure you...

39:10.500 --> 39:11.660
一切都在我们掌控之中
we have everything under control.

39:11.660 --> 39:12.350
后退  我要烧死你们
Stay back! I'll burn you!

39:12.350 --> 39:13.660
我好像看不出
Not getting a real

39:13.660 --> 39:16.180
是在"掌控之中"啊  马蒂
"Under control" vibe here, Marty.

39:16.180 --> 39:17.660
-你是叫格伦吧  -丹尼尔
- It is Glen, isn't it? - Daniel.

39:17.660 --> 39:19.690
回答我的问题就行  米格尔
I'll ask the questions, Miguel.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.040
让我和这孩子谈谈
Let me talk to the kid.

39:21.040 --> 39:25.620
你和你这双奇怪的性感秘密双唇待在这里
You stay here with your weird, secret sex lips.

39:27.530 --> 39:29.120
-你想死吗  -这孩子这么可爱
- You wanna die? - This kid's adorable.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.580
真不知道我为什么还带了空包弹
I don't know why I packed the hollow points.

39:30.590 --> 39:32.090
我要烧掉你们的蛋蛋
I'll burn your balls off!

39:32.090 --> 39:34.930
第一天  我好紧张
First day. I'm so nervous!

39:35.410 --> 39:37.160
你刚刚说"空包弹"吗
Did you just say "Hollow points"?

39:37.160 --> 39:39.810
没错  也许应该带一把超级水枪
Yeah, probably should've brought a Super Soaker.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.140
你好
Hi, there!

39:43.320 --> 39:46.130
后退  不然我就弄死那个贾斯汀·比伯
Stay back or Justin Bieber dies!

39:46.990 --> 39:49.140
贾斯汀·比伯  他叫你贾斯汀·比伯
Justin Bieber. He called you Justin Bieber.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.390
等等  等等  等等
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

39:52.390 --> 39:55.560
我们还是先别来这一套不知道什么玩意
Okay, let's not do whatever that is.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.860
行吗  我们先谈谈
Okay? Let's just talk!

39:56.860 --> 39:58.740
你叫罗斯  对吧
It's Russell, right?

39:58.740 --> 40:01.180
-火拳  -火拳
- Firefist. - Firefist.

40:01.180 --> 40:03.300
这名号不错  烧到哪里
Ooh, that's a great name. Where does it burn?

40:03.300 --> 40:05.440
就烧拳头  还是烧到手肘
Just the fist, or all the way up to the elbow?

40:10.380 --> 40:12.130
绝对是烧到手肘
Definitely all the way up to the elbow.

40:12.130 --> 40:15.390
乖乖跟我们走  不然会惹上麻烦
Come quietly, or there will be trouble.

40:15.390 --> 40:17.800
-这句话是《机械战警》的  -是《机械战警》的
- You stole that from Robocop! - That's from Robocop!

40:17.800 --> 40:19.590
后退
Just stand down!

40:19.590 --> 40:23.300
你真让我丢脸  听着  火...  天啊
You're embarrassing me. Look, Fire... Oh, my God!

40:24.470 --> 40:26.860
我说不出口  我真的很抱歉
I can't say it! I'm so sorry!

40:30.560 --> 40:34.360
该死  真他妈够了
Oh, shit! That fucking does it!

40:34.360 --> 40:35.570
把手放在你的膝盖后
Put your hands behind your knees

40:35.570 --> 40:37.710
把头蹲下来  马上
and get down on your head! Now!

40:37.710 --> 40:39.680
韦德  第一条规则是什么
Wade! What was first rule?

40:39.680 --> 40:41.480
给冰箱里的所有东西贴上标签
Label everything in the refrigerator!

40:41.480 --> 40:44.370
-不要擅自升序  -规则就是用来破坏的
- Do not escalate! - Rules are meant to be broken!

40:44.370 --> 40:47.330
那跟设定规则的本意恰好背道而驰
That's the exact opposite of what they're meant for!

40:48.210 --> 40:49.740
操  好吧
Fuck! Fine!

40:50.160 --> 40:51.780
那我从头开始
I'll start from the beginning.

40:51.810 --> 40:54.280
我叫死侍  我是一名X战警
My name is Deadpool, and I'm an X-Man.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.320
-实习生  -闭嘴
- Trainee! - Shut it!

40:57.070 --> 40:59.510
听着  我明白
Look, I get it.

41:00.680 --> 41:02.080
你很害怕
All right, you're scared.

41:02.810 --> 41:03.820
孤单
Alone.

41:04.100 --> 41:04.820
你没有家庭
You got no family.

41:04.820 --> 41:06.130
我也没有家庭
I didn't have a family, either.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.920
你住在这个垃圾堆  你猜怎么着
You live in this dump. Guess what?

41:07.920 --> 41:09.850
我以前也住在这种狗洞
I used to live in a shithole just like it.

41:10.420 --> 41:11.530
但是你知道吗
But you know something?

41:11.890 --> 41:13.830
一个智慧的女人曾跟我说过
A wise woman once said to me...

41:13.830 --> 41:14.860
"大声点"
"Speak up."

41:15.300 --> 41:17.740
"你嘴里含着屌  说话听不到"
"I can't hear you with that pity dick in your mouth."

41:18.230 --> 41:20.030
太过了吗  我扯太远了
Too much? I went too far.

41:27.300 --> 41:28.770
真兴奋
That was effervescent.

41:29.770 --> 41:31.200
好好读书  孩子
Stay in school, kid.

41:31.550 --> 41:33.390
不读也行  我就没读
Or don't. I didn't.

41:33.570 --> 41:34.810
而我现在是一名X战警
And I'm an X-Man.

41:35.140 --> 41:36.470
实习生
Trainee.

41:36.470 --> 41:37.280
操
Fuck it!

41:37.280 --> 41:39.300
超级英雄式落地
Superhero landing coming up!

41:39.600 --> 41:41.180
瑞安·雷诺兹[签名]
金刚狼燕麦片

41:41.560 --> 41:44.800
操操操
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!

41:44.810 --> 41:47.230
第一部中吐槽"那样真的对膝盖很不好"

41:44.810 --> 41:47.230
这种落地法真是太不现实了
That is so not practical.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.720
我也许能适应这种X战警的方式
I could get used to this X-Man shit.

42:09.720 --> 42:10.680
实习生
Trainee!

42:10.680 --> 42:11.860
实习生
Trainee!

42:11.860 --> 42:13.610
给他上能力束缚带  快
Get a power restraint on him. Now!

42:13.610 --> 42:17.240
冷静点  小松鼠  结束了  抓到你了
Calm down, squirt. It's over. We got ya.

42:19.010 --> 42:20.200
那是用来干什么的
What's that do?

42:20.200 --> 42:21.850
能力衰减项圈
Power-dampening collar.

42:21.850 --> 42:23.670
抑制所有变种人能力
Shuts down all mutant abilities.

42:23.670 --> 42:26.310
摘不下来  除非用手榴弹
You can't get it off. Unless you've got a grenade.

42:27.260 --> 42:29.430
本来一开始就可以用这个
Could've used one of those in the first act.

42:29.430 --> 42:30.490
谢谢你
Thank you!

42:32.310 --> 42:34.810
真是太令人激动了
That was absolutely thrilling.

42:34.810 --> 42:36.960
真正的英雄主义
True heroism in action.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.610
我们欠你的
We are in your debt.

42:39.140 --> 42:41.060
接下来就交给我们吧
We can take it from here.

42:41.060 --> 42:43.320
带我去冰盒吧  求你了
Take me to the Ice Box, please!

42:43.320 --> 42:44.590
任何地方都比这里好
Anywhere's better than here.

42:44.590 --> 42:45.610
相信我  孩子
Believe me, son,

42:45.610 --> 42:47.740
你绝对不想去冰盒的
you do not wanna go to the Ice Box.

42:47.740 --> 42:50.170
跟那儿对比  希特勒的肛门都能算旅游胜地
That place makes Hitler's anus look like Waikiki.

42:50.180 --> 42:51.980
先带你进去吧  年轻人
Let's get you inside, young man.

42:51.980 --> 42:53.590
不  等一下  等一下
No, wait, wait. Wait.

42:53.590 --> 42:55.580
你们待着别动
You guys stay there.

43:05.870 --> 43:07.170
那些人伤害你了吗
Those guys hurt you?

43:08.920 --> 43:09.840
谁
Who?

43:12.350 --> 43:15.130
特朗普女婿

43:12.350 --> 43:15.130
那个秃头  还是贾罗德·库辛那
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?

43:16.150 --> 43:17.210
两个都是
Both of 'em?

43:21.660 --> 43:23.040
去他妈的
Oh, fuck it.

43:23.040 --> 43:24.570
四五个瞬间
Four or five moments!

43:24.570 --> 43:25.660
什么
I'm sorry?

43:25.790 --> 43:29.000
四五个瞬间
Four or five moments!

43:30.300 --> 43:33.670
做英雄只需要这点时间
That's all it takes to be a hero.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.520
人们以为你醒来就是英雄样
People think you wake up a hero...

43:36.520 --> 43:38.620
刷牙就是英雄样
brush your teeth a hero...

43:38.620 --> 43:41.320
手淫到洗洁精盒里就是英雄样
ejaculate into a soap dispenser a hero.

43:42.840 --> 43:47.220
但是不  做英雄只要几分钟
But, no, being a hero takes only a few moments!

43:47.990 --> 43:49.210
几分钟
A few moments...

43:49.740 --> 43:52.410
做别人不愿意做的脏活
doing the ugly stuff no one else will do.

43:55.860 --> 43:56.820
不
No!

43:59.580 --> 44:00.870
后退  不要开火
Stand down! Hold your fire!

44:00.870 --> 44:03.170
-韦德  你做了什么  -钢力士  不要
- Wade, what did you do? - Colossus, no!

44:03.170 --> 44:06.810
你说得对  韦德  你不是当X战警的料
You were right, Wade. You are not X-Men material.

44:06.810 --> 44:09.020
不是吧  闪亮甘地
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!

44:09.020 --> 44:10.600
你怎么看出来的
What was your first clue?

44:10.600 --> 44:13.730
透过那混蛋脸上的穿过去的弹孔吗
The hollow point through that fuckhead's face?

44:13.730 --> 44:15.030
那孩子遭到虐待了
That kid was abused!

44:15.040 --> 44:17.280
-你看得出来  永远看得出来  -我们有规矩
- You can tell, you can  always tell! - We have rules!

44:17.280 --> 44:19.860
你不是法官  陪审团或行刑者
You are not judge, jury or executioner!

44:19.860 --> 44:23.030
去你的规则  我为正确的事而战
Fuck your rules! I fight for what's right!

44:23.030 --> 44:24.750
有时候就得用脏的
And sometimes you gotta fight dirty!

44:24.750 --> 44:27.910
你最后一次让我失望了  韦德
You let me down for the last time, Wade.

44:31.250 --> 44:33.130
把这些人关起来
Okay, get these guys in the pod.

44:33.130 --> 44:34.780
带他们去冰盒
Take them to the Ice Box.

44:56.020 --> 44:57.450
宝贝
Hey, baby!

44:58.260 --> 45:00.040
不知道我会加入什么帮派
I wonder what gang I'll be in.

45:02.250 --> 45:04.080
有没有分院帽之类的东西
Is there, like, a Sorting Hat?

45:05.650 --> 45:09.330
我一直觉得我自己更适合进东海岸赫奇帕奇学院
I've always seen myself as more of an East Coast Hufflepuff.

45:10.520 --> 45:13.470
我在爱彼迎上预定时犯了一个巨大的错误
I've made a critical error on my Airbnb reservation.

45:13.470 --> 45:17.640
网站上看起来明明不是这样的
This is not what the website looked like at all.

45:19.180 --> 45:20.830
不过我很喜欢这装修风格
I love the decor though.

45:20.830 --> 45:23.020
我真没想到绝望真的是一种颜色
I had no idea hopeless was a color.

45:23.020 --> 45:24.480
左转  蠢蛋
Hard left, douchebag.

45:28.640 --> 45:29.980
你先进
Please, after you.

45:32.010 --> 45:34.730
又是个街头烦人的小子
Another disgusting minority off the streets.

45:34.730 --> 45:35.880
今晚能睡个好觉了
We'll sleep well tonight.

45:35.880 --> 45:37.030
我们去吃个甜甜圈吧
Let's get a bagel.

45:40.370 --> 45:42.520
晚安  烦人的家伙
Nighty-night, you annoying prick!

46:18.790 --> 46:20.920
你完全没了你的超能力
You're a long way from your superpowers.

46:20.920 --> 46:23.270
就是个小癌症
Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.

46:23.270 --> 46:25.110
别担心  早就得了
Not to worry, we're old friends.

46:26.950 --> 46:29.300
我曾经很想做超级英雄
I wanted to be a superhero.

46:29.300 --> 46:31.380
一直想要一套真正的超级英雄战服
Always wanted a real super suit.

46:31.680 --> 46:32.840
然后发生了什么
What happened?

46:32.840 --> 46:35.760
你什么时候见过超胖的超级英雄
When was the last time you saw a plus-sized superhero?

46:35.760 --> 46:36.700
从来没见过
Never.

46:37.240 --> 46:38.980
行业歧视
The industry discriminates.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.660
去他们妈的超级英雄
Fuck superheroes.

46:41.870 --> 46:44.360
最让我生气的是
The thing that pisses me off the most...

46:44.360 --> 46:46.670
我从来没有为自己站出来过
I never stood up for myself in there.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.700
我这一辈子
My whole life.

46:50.940 --> 46:53.830
我一直在等待别人来拯救我
I've been waiting for someone to come and save me.

46:56.860 --> 46:59.570
没有人为了我做出什么牺牲
Nobody's gonna sacrifice anything for me.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.070
我得开始自己照顾自己
I gotta start taking care of myself.

47:07.510 --> 47:08.940
我现在有任务了
I have a mission now.

47:10.260 --> 47:12.540
等我出去  要做的第一件事就是...
The first thing I wanna do when I get out of here...

47:12.970 --> 47:14.810
活活烧死那个校长
burn the headmaster alive...

47:15.500 --> 47:18.380
然后跟他的尸体残骸拍一张自拍
and then take a selfie with his smoldering corpse.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.230
这是我在《圣经》中最喜欢的部分
That's, like, my favorite part of the Bible.

47:23.450 --> 47:24.730
我身上没有袜子玩偶
I don't have a sock puppet on me...

47:24.730 --> 47:27.130
但是他对你做了什么
but what did he do to you?

47:27.890 --> 47:29.550
他尝了尝彩虹吗[鸡奸]
Did he taste the rainbow?

47:29.550 --> 47:31.960
我应该小声说的  但那样彩虹糖就会告我们
I'd whisper it, but Skittles would sue us.

47:32.790 --> 47:34.340
那混蛋恨变种人
Fucker hates mutants.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.790
他想通过折磨我们  毁灭我们的基因
He tried to beat the genes out of us.

47:36.790 --> 47:39.700
没有比相信"祈祷能消灭同性恋"更可怕的人了
Nothing worse than a "Pray the gay away" Type guy.

47:39.700 --> 47:41.560
该死的混蛋
Sick piece of shit.

47:42.880 --> 47:46.230
明天  我们要找到这里块头最大的家伙
Tomorrow, we'll find the biggest guy in here...

47:47.640 --> 47:49.240
然后让他变成我们的人
and we'll make him our bitch!

47:52.490 --> 47:53.800
怎么回事
What was that?

47:54.330 --> 47:57.020
那就是这里块头最大的家伙
That is the biggest guy in here.

47:54.970 --> 47:57.060
最高安全级别区域

47:57.020 --> 47:59.300
冰盒有个传说
Fun fact about the Ice Box...

47:59.300 --> 48:01.200
尽管从来没有人亲眼目睹过
though no one's ever seen it,

48:01.200 --> 48:03.460
他们在地下室关了一个大怪兽
they keep a monster in the basement.

48:03.470 --> 48:06.780
埋下了一个巨大又呼之欲出的伏笔
Right next to a huge, steaming bowl of foreshadowing.

48:07.430 --> 48:08.240
听着
Look.

48:09.310 --> 48:10.680
我没法保护你
I can't protect you.

48:11.660 --> 48:12.690
只要戴着这个项圈
With this collar on,

48:12.690 --> 48:16.070
我的超能力就只有脱缰的癌症
my superpower is just unbridled cancer.

48:16.070 --> 48:19.070
给我一把弓和箭  我基本就是鹰眼了
Give me a bow and arrow, I'm basically Hawkeye.

48:19.380 --> 48:21.160
不好意思
Now, if you'll excuse me...

48:21.630 --> 48:24.860
我还要慢慢长肿瘤  凡妮莎还在等我
I've got tumors to grow. Vanessa awaits.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.820
我要给我们做个称手的家伙
I'll start by making us a shank.

48:27.350 --> 48:29.410
-行吧  -我偷了警卫的笔
- Good listening. - I stole that guard's pen...

48:29.410 --> 48:31.560
藏在了监狱传统储物处
and stashed it in the old prison wallet,

48:31.560 --> 48:32.840
如果你听得懂的话
if you know what I'm saying.

48:32.840 --> 48:34.940
我真希望我听不懂你说的话
I really hope I don't know what you're saying.

48:37.420 --> 48:39.430
我知道就在里面  就是得拿出来
I know it's in there, I just need to get it out.

48:39.430 --> 48:41.790
上帝啊
Oh, Jesus Christ.

48:41.790 --> 48:44.360
我可以听到你在里面翻找的声音
I can hear you rummaging around in there.

48:44.610 --> 48:47.060
他们会提供洗耳朵的洗液吗
Do they make Purell for your ears?

48:51.550 --> 48:54.280

49:00.140 --> 49:02.020

什么  你为什么要冲我眨眼
What? Why are you winking at me?

49:56.650 --> 49:57.960
我罩着你
I got your back.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.320

我拍过几张封面照
I've done some light catalog work...

50:14.440 --> 50:17.330
但是做模特其实只是进军演艺界的跳板
but, really, modeling is just a stepping stone to acting.

50:17.330 --> 50:18.880
我是在和他说话
I was talking to him.

50:20.130 --> 50:23.100
我们见过吗  我记不得你的小胡子了
Have we met? I can't place your mustache.

You're supposed to be the toughest cunt in here.

这也太滑了  这桌子要擦一下
Oh, it's slippery, too. This table needs a wipe down!

50:51.500 --> 50:53.370
能不能把这桌子擦一下
Can we get a wipe down on the table?

50:54.660 --> 50:56.970
孩子  我觉得你站错边了
Kid, I think you picked the wrong side.

50:56.980 --> 50:59.520
不  我没有  他是我的朋友
No, I didn't! He's my friend!

闭嘴  我们不是朋友
Zip it. We're not friends.

51:23.030 --> 51:24.630
我们是完美的团队
We make a great team!

51:24.910 --> 51:26.490
天啊  我们不是团队
Oh, God! We're not a team.

51:27.370 --> 51:32.050
你之前为什么那么说  我们是朋友  搭档
Why'd you say that back there? We're friends, partners.

51:32.050 --> 51:33.900
我们不是搭档  或朋友
We're not partners or friends.

51:35.790 --> 51:37.780
结局不会是我们奔向落日
This doesn't end with us riding into the sunset.

51:37.780 --> 51:40.060
而是我死于癌症
It ends with me dying of cancer...

51:40.060 --> 51:43.530
你赢下了冰盒最柔软嘴巴奖

全世界我只在乎一个人
There's only one person in this world that I care about,

51:51.230 --> 51:52.500
你想活下来吗
You wanna survive?

51:53.860 --> 51:56.410
别再想着搞定块头最大的家伙了...
Stop trying to shank the biggest guys in here...

51:57.230 --> 51:58.680
跟他们做朋友

52:00.310 --> 52:01.960
找个人做朋友
Make friends with someone.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.600

别难过  我自己都弄不死我自己
Don't feel bad. Even I can't kill me.

56:51.450 --> 56:52.410
快说
Talk!

56:52.950 --> 56:56.580
什么样的孬种会想杀死一个14岁的孩子
What kind of spineless shit stick tries to kill a 14-year-old boy?

56:57.560 --> 56:58.580
你最好还是赶紧开口
You might wanna start talking!

Dubstep's for pussies.

58:07.990 --> 58:09.250
你好黑暗

你确定你不是从DC宇宙过来的吗
Are you sure you're not from the DC universe?

58:12.350 --> 58:14.380
我爱回响贝斯
I love dubstep!

58:40.320 --> 58:41.790
那是个腰包吗
Is that a fanny pack?

58:41.790 --> 58:44.520
我1990年后就没见过这玩意了
I used to have one of those in 1990-never.

58:45.460 --> 58:47.470
这可以用来纪念你
Something to remember you by.

58:47.470 --> 58:51.370
还给我  我去哪儿都会带着这枚硬币
Give me that back! That goes with me everywhere.

58:51.370 --> 58:54.050
就像你关于腰包的记忆一样
Like the memory of your fucking fanny pack!

59:03.510 --> 59:05.610
你为什么要保护那孩子
Why are you protecting the kid?

59:06.710 --> 59:08.890
我才不在乎他
I don't give a fuck about him...

59:09.510 --> 59:12.050
儿童绘本

59:09.510 --> 59:12.050
以及他的《你是我的妈妈吗》系列
and his Are You My Mother? complex!

59:14.310 --> 59:15.630
这是用来干什么的
What's this one do?

59:29.440 --> 59:30.780
所有电影中  英雄都会
In every film, there's a moment

59:30.780 --> 59:33.200

In Cool Runnings, it was when John Candy's

59:35.360 --> 59:37.150

妮莎
Ness?

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.090
妮莎
Hey, Ness!

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.500
妮莎  你能让我进去吗
Ness, can you let me in?

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.320
求你了  求你了
Please! Please.

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.000
上帝啊
Jesus.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.770
你给我的提示太少了
You're not giving me a lot of direction here.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:26.320
我已经到末路了
I'm at the end of my rope.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.020
后来我加入了X战警
Then I joined the X-Men.

01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:33.660
我进了监狱  我...
I went to prison. I, uh...

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.720
是那个孩子吗
Is it the kid?

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.880
孩子们给我们一个机会变得更好
Kids give us a chance to be better than we used to be.

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.260
那个孩子
The kid!

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.950
那就是她的意思

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.950
也许我救不了凡妮莎
Maybe I couldn't save Vanessa...

01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:18.670
但也许我能拯救新西兰的青壮少年
but maybe I can save a robust teenager from New Zealand.

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:21.090
但是我的意思是"无私"这个词
Yeah, but what I mean is, like, the word "Selfless."

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:22.830
我真的不懂那是什么意思
I literally don't know what that means.

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:23.680

我可能可以派上大用场
I could be of great use.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:11.790
分配器中有足够的卫生棉吗

Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:47.760

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:03.990
我没有能力
I don't have one.

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:05.800
我只是看到了广告
Um, I just saw the ad.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.260
没有任何超能力吗
No superpowers at all?

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:11.200
我有1型和2型糖尿病
Uh, I have both Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

That's all the diabetes.

如果你发现3型  记得告诉我们
If you find a Type 3, let us know.

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:18.610

This is Convoy 17 departing the Ice Box.

01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:49.070
正在路上
We are en route.

01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.970
和平时期让人软弱
Peacetime makes people soft.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.690
我生于战争
I was born into war.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.640

你感受过的最痛苦的事是什么
What's the most pain you've ever felt?

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:13.690
这些束带挺...
These restraints are pretty...

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.550
大家以为理解痛苦
People think they understand pain.

01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:17.300
其实他们对痛苦根本没有概念
They have no concept of it

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.290
他们只知道自己最糟糕的经历
beyond their own worst experience.

01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:23.940
对五岁的人来说
5 years old. That's what?

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:25.540
是被蜜蜂蛰
A bee sting.

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:26.680
对

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:31.470
对40岁的人来说  疾病
40 years old, disease.

01:08:32.230 --> 01:08:36.700
或许那种经历会让你变得机械部分多于肉体部分
Maybe the kind that leaves you more machine than man.

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.330
怂货不会变老
Yeah, getting old's not for sissies.

01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:40.210
所以我奶奶以前经常...
That's what my Grandma Ginny used to...

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:41.420
我排了顺序
I've got a list.

01:08:42.190 --> 01:08:44.090
我们要按照上面的顺序来
We're gonna work down it.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.780
一起
Together.

01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:49.480
首先我要掰弯点东西
Number one, I'm gonna bend something.

01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:52.420
有些原本不该弯的东西
Something that was not meant to bend.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.420
你还是就此打住吧
I'm gonna stop you right there

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.740
我肯定坚持不到第二条
because I'm not gonna make it to two.

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.100
我连第一条都坚持不到
I won't even make it to one.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.740
我受不了痛苦
I don't do well with pain, you know.

01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.540
如果撞到脚趾头  那我一天就毁了
If I stub my toe, I'm done for the day.

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.630
我喜欢的《费丽丝蒂》被取消时我都哭了
I cried when they canceled Felicity.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.950
我真正害怕时  会因为紧张而勃起
When I get really scared, I get nervous erections.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.040
现在我就勃起了
I have one right now.

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:07.720
你别看  越看我越勃起
Don't look. It'll only make it worse.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.590
我不想让你伤害我
I don't want you to hurt me,

01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:11.060
你想知道的事我都会告诉你
and I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:13.800
除了他们在哪里
Except for where they are.

01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:15.980
罗素在一个车队里  在杰瑞大根大道
Russell's in a convoy heading southbound

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.580
往南行使
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:18.300
那怪物跟他们在一起
The monster's with them.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.460
-我可不想招惹他  -你们都知道计划
-I wouldn't fuck with him. - You all know the plan.

01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.440
拦截车队
Intercept the convoy,

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.640
救出男孩  但方式要对
grab the boy. But not inappropriately!

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.890
知道吗 我也不想招惹死侍
You know what, i wouldn't fuck with Deadpool either.

01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:28.680
因为他组建了一个队伍  他所向无敌
Because he's built a team. He's unstoppable.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.450
他屁股里有支笔  他会用那个捅你
He has an ass pen. He'll stab you with it.

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:33.920
小心这个家伙  电索
Watch out for this guy, Cable!

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.220
他很矮  一米八  不跟漫画里一样
He's very short, 5'11". Not like in the comics.

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.940
如果我们成功  我们就早回家
And if we succeed, we all go home early.

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:42.290
所以如果你去对付他们  电索  我警告你
So if you go after them, Cable, I warn you...

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.170
注意大风
there's a wind advisory in effect.

01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:58.110
上面风有点大
A little turbulent up here.

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.910
我不是很了解这个叫电索的伙计
I don't know much about this Cable fella...

01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:08.290
不过我保证  他杀的人
but I guarantee he hasn't killed

01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:10.230
肯定不如黑素瘤害死的人多
as many people as melanoma has.

01:10:12.150 --> 01:10:13.280
就快到了
We're getting close!

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.870
作为前X战警...
As a former X-Man...

01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:16.860
-是实习生  -谢谢  喧嚣
- Trainee. - Thank you, Bedlam.

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.790
我一直都震惊于那伙人名字中
I was always appalled by the blatant sexism

01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:20.830
如此赤裸裸的性别歧视
in the group's name.

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:22.690
X战警[男人]  非得男人吗
X-Men! Men!

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:25.760
重点是  我们要有前瞻性思维
The point is, our group will be forward thinking.

01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:27.360
性别中立
Gender neutral.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.920
此后我们就叫...
From now on, we'll be known as...

01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:33.200
X特工队
X-Force.

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:35.070
是不是有点山寨啊
Isn't that a little derivative?

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:37.730
我没问你的意见  皮特
I don't recall asking your opinion, Peter!

01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:39.910
不是我说的
That wasn't me.

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.640
降到1300英尺开始跳
Hang the laundry out at 1,300 feet...

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.460
拦截车队  救出男孩
intercept the convoy, and grab the boy.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:52.890
来场大屠杀吧  宝贝儿
Let's bring on the carnage, baby!

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:55.200
把我放到地面  瞧好吧
Get me on the ground, watch me go!

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.550
太想去杀人了
I can't wait to kill!

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.730
我想说我真的为这支队伍骄傲
I just wanna say how proud I am of this team.

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.940
你们看起来棒极了
You know, you guys look amazing!

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.420
消隐者  毫无疑问你看起来也很棒
Vanisher, I have no doubt you look amazing too.

01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:09.520
这是我一直
This is the family

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.490
梦想拥有的大家庭  我...
that I've always dreamed of having and I...

01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:13.070
见鬼
Ah, shit.

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:16.760
我有时候会突然就说不下去了
I just get a little choked up sometimes.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.160
我不想打断  不过有人
I hate to interrupt, but is anybody nervous

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.110
对大风紧张吗
about the high winds?

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:21.470
-盖瑞  -我叫皮特
- Gary. - My name's Peter.

01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:23.560
我知道你第一次干这种事  不过尽管放松
I realize that you're new to this, but relax.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.290
你是被至高权力选中的人
You've been chosen by a higher power.

01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:27.390
-他刚才说自己是上帝吗  -好像是
- Did he just call himself God? - I think he did.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.090
-我想回家  -我还想
- I'd like to go home. - And I'd like...

01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:31.580
麦当劳烤汁猪排堡全年供应呢
the McRib to be available year round,

01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:33.680
但有时候梦想不会成真
but sometimes dreams don't come true.

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:35.730
我在特种部队待了十年
I spent 10 years in Special Forces.

01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:37.130
你以为我们会因为一点小风
You think we didn't jump out of the plane

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:38.930
就不从飞机里跳下去吗
because of a light breeze?

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.320
你别无可去了  小胡子
You're in this shit now, Mustache!

01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:43.470
我大喊只是为了给其他人看
I'm only yelling to impress the other guys.

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:45.630
我绝不会让你出事的  小甜心
I'd never let anything happen to you, Sugarbear.

01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:47.880
莱纳德  来吧
Leonard, hit it!

01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:58.860
跳  跳  跳
Go! Go! Go!

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.630
来爽一把
Let's get some!

01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:41.220
车队在12点钟方向  听我口令
Convoy, 12 o'clock! On my command!

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.050
部署  搞什么
Deploy! Oh, hey now!

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.950
有点偏离轨道
Little off course here.

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:56.910
我勒个大操
Holy mommy fucking shit!

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.360
他们在那里
Ah, there they are.

01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:02.010
看这些华丽的混蛋
Look at these gorgeous sons of bitches.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.080
好样的  喧嚣
Oh, yeah! That's right, Bedlam!

01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:14.130
不  真他娘操蛋
No! Tripping motherfucking billies!

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:17.580
里碎星  你可以的
Shatterstar. Okay, you got this.

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:19.440
往左
Left!

01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:20.490
往左
Left!

01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:22.670
这种天气还要起飞  肯定是疯了
You'd have to be insane to take off in this.

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:24.850
不对  是左边  白痴
No, stage left, you idiot!

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.820
好吧  看来我们找到了
Well, I guess we found something

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.140
你没有比我们更强的方面
you're not better at.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.740
消隐者
Vanisher.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.260
前方布拉德·皮特警告

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.760
或许风吹不毁它看不到的东西
Maybe the wind can't blow what it can't see.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.630
不是吧
Oh! Really?

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.850
好吧  四个人也可以
All right, we could do this with four.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.120
小甜心  你可以的  伙计
Sugarbear. You got this, buddy!

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.650
好样的  这才是X特工队精神
That's the stuff! That's the X-Force spirit!

01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:52.590
不要低估一个留小胡子的人
Never underestimate a man with a mustache!

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:54.540
不信随便找布鲁克林的人问问
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:55.550
我们成功了
We did it!

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:57.010
你绝对是超级英雄
You're a goddamn superhero, you!

01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:58.140
X特工队
X-Force!

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.020
X特工队
X-Force.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.590
皮特
Peter.

01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:11.260
我来救你  伙计
I got you, buddy!

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.720
-你不会有事的  -糟糕了
- You're gonna be fine! - This is not good, man!

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.730
你可以的  大兄弟  加油  皮特
You got this, big guy! Here we go, Peter!

01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:17.730
看着我  我们是X特工队  对吧
Look at me. We're X-Force, right?

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.800
-对  我们是  -我们是X特工队
- Yeah, we're X-Force. - We're X-Force.

01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:25.360
苍天  搞什么
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.140
该死的酸性呕吐物
Fucking acidic vomit!

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:32.300
天啊  我要吐在面具里了
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up in my mask.

01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:37.170
我到达车队上方了
Okay, I'm over the convoy.

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:39.280
队伍其他人都降落在哪里了
Where did the rest of the team land?

01:14:40.050 --> 01:14:41.680
好消息和坏消息
Good news and bad news.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.740
坏消息是整个队伍的人都死了
Bad news is the whole team is dead.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.130
好消息是
The good news is,

01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:48.150
我觉得不会有人怀念里碎星的
I don't think anyone's gonna miss Shatterstar.

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:51.380
他有点混蛋  不过保罗
He was a bit of a prick. Oh, but Paul!

01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:52.150
皮特
Peter!

01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:53.930
皮特  我最怀念的会是他
Peter, I'm gonna miss him most.

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:55.310
不过还有一丢丢可能
But there is a slight chance

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.620
消隐者能成功落地
Vanisher could make it.

01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:59.120
可能为零了  他死了
Nope, no chance. He's dead.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.280
全军覆没
The whole team?

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.360
只剩主力了  我们还是可以的
Only the main ones. We're still good.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.610
操  你个蠢货
Fuck, you are dumb.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.200
安排这些特技表演的人
Whoever planned this stunt's

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.510
肯定抽了很多大麻
been smoking a lot jazz cabbage.

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:08.740
我话放这儿了
I'll tell you that much.

01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:10.210
那不是显而易见
That's pretty obvious!

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.790
你看起来不错  消隐者
Looking good, Vanisher.

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:23.860
他们进入隧道了
They're headed into the tunnel.

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.140
我是那个孩子的唯一希望
I'm that kid's only hope,

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.620
不要轻举妄动  等我的口令
so sit tight and wait for my word.

01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:29.990
随便
Whatever.

01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:31.620
要跟丢他们了  我要落地了
We're gonna lose 'em. I'm dropping in.

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:34.100
不行  唯一的幸存者
Uh, that's a negative, sole survivor.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:37.010
幸运不是超能力  我们完蛋了
Luck is not a superpower! We are so fucked!

01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:39.970
不  我们当然没有完蛋
No, we most certainly are not fucked.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.640
说真的  我搞不懂
Seriously, I don't get it!

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.270
你是从眼睛里发射幸运镭射的吗
What, you shoot luck lasers out of your eyes?

01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:52.160
我真的很难想象
It's just it's hard to picture.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.420
而且很没有观影性
And certainly not very cinematic.

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.420
运气  不是吧
I mean, luck?

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.350
什么样的扯淡胡闹
What coked out, glass pipe-sucking

01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:02.710
神经病漫画家
freakshow comic book artist...

01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:04.300
才会想出这种桥段
came up with that little chestnut?

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.740
大概是个连脚都不会画的家伙
Probably a guy who can't draw feet!

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.740
指死侍漫画作者罗伯·莱菲尔德
作品出了名的腿部比例奇怪

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:20.860
任务又一次全部落到了我的肩上
Once again, it all falls on my shoulders.

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:22.730
所以我才被诅咒成为独行侠
It's why I'm cursed to be a solo act.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:23.630
-在地球...  -我就位了
- Wander the Earth... - I'm in.

01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:25.140
抱歉  你说什么
I'm sorry, what did you say?

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:25.950
我就位了
I'm in.

01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:28.530
你他妈怎么就就位了
How in the fuck are you in already?

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:29.540
见鬼
Oh, shit.

01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:31.770
是电索  12点钟方向
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:32.550
好的
Okay.

01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:35.510
新计划  用你所有的想象力
New plan. Use all of your imaginary powers

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:37.660
阻止电索杀死那个孩子
to stop Cable from killing that kid.

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:39.340
我从你六点钟方向来了
I'm coming up on your six.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.300
那把枪太赞了
That gun is amazing!

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.700
混球
Hey! Asshole!

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.680
他在哪里  我看不到他
Where is he? I can't see him.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.140
他在你上面
He's on top of you.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.140
他把你撕开了
He's tearing you open!

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:08.000
他从后面进去了
He's going in through the back!

01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:09.960
天啊  他进去了
Oh, God, he's inside!

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:10.840
你知道自己在说什么吧
You hear yourself, right?

01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:12.710
不小心双关了
Accidental double entendres!

01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:15.070
罗素  罗素·柯林斯
Russell! Russell Collins!

01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:17.150
别碰那个孩子  约翰·康纳
Hands off that kid, John Connor!

01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:23.570
不不不
No, no, no!

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.690
该死
Shit!

01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:52.290
两个人也能行
Two can play that game!

01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:56.280
来了  失败了
Got it! No, I don't.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.300
好戏该上演了  美女
Showtime, mama!

01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.820
幸运女神  你来开车
Lady Luck, take the wheel.

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:39.810
我应该问问你是谁  不过你马上就要死了
I'd ask who you are, but you'll be dead in a second.

01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:42.210
我是多米诺  我表示怀疑
I'm Domino, and doubtful.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.890
坚持住  多米诺
Hang in there, Doms!

01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:02.910
这样真的太难了
Oh, this is really hard.

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:16.600
把我的滑雪球币还给我
And give me back my Skee-Ball token.

01:19:19.330 --> 01:19:21.370
-你表现很棒  -X特工队
- You're doing great. - X-Force.

01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:25.150
看来回响贝斯永远不死
I guess dubstep never dies.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.680
你杀了布莱克·汤姆  你个种族主义混蛋
You killed Black Tom, you racist son of a bitch!

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:44.370
这就不走运了
That's unfortunate.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.560
刹车坏了
We got no brakes!

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.040
想办法
Figure it out!

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:55.990
没有我杀不死的东西
There's nothing I can't kill.

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.870
正如男童子军团长凯文所说
Well, as Scoutmaster Kevin used to say...

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.420
"凡事总有第一次  孩子"
"There's a first time for everything, son."

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.390
把你的本事使出来吧  独眼龙
Give me your best shot, One-Eyed Willy.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.640
那些子弹还真快啊
Those bullets were, like, super fast.

01:20:23.970 --> 01:20:24.930
来吧
Here we go.

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.400
多米诺  慢一点好吗
Domino, mind slowing us down?

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.030
没办法了
Here goes nothing.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.000
叮咚
Knock, knock.

01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:03.460
最高安全级别区域

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:11.870
好样的
That's my boy.

01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:19.320
我的天...
Holy...

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.660
首先我要承认
I'll be first to admit...

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:33.190
这跟计划中不太一样
this did not go according to plan.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.540
我还要首先承认
I'll also be the first to admit that

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.790
计划是用蜡笔写的
that plan was written in crayon.

01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:40.950
看来罗素找到了新朋友  好嫉妒哦
Looks like Russell found a new friend. Jelly.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.030
事实证明  多米诺是个狠角色
Turns out Domino's a bit of a badass,

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:45.710
或许还有点走运
and maybe, possibly mildly lucky.

01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:49.020
但是电索  那家伙真是情绪太大了
But Cable? Ugh. That guy's in a mood.

01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:50.160
而且他的情绪
A mood that is

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.570
马上就会更大
about to get significantly worse.

01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:18.460
感觉非常非常不对劲
Something is so terribly, terribly wrong.

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:26.090
苍天  好疼
Oh, God, that hurt.

01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:28.270
去死吧  梅尔·吉布森
Suck it, Mel Gibson.

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:32.580
罗素
Russell.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.120
罗素
Russell!

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.210
罗素  你在哪里
Russ, where are ya?

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.910
罗素  罗素  你没事
Russell. Russell, you're okay!

01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:48.370
谢天谢地  天啊
Oh, thank God. Oh, my God!

01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:49.630
红坦克
Juggernaut!

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:52.850
我就知道是你
I thought that was you!

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:54.970
我应该穿白裤子来的
I should've worn my white pants.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.650
可能你已经见怪不怪了  但我是你的铁杆粉丝
You probably get this a lot, but I am a huge fan.

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:03.230
《X战警  神秘版》183期  《雷神》411期
Uncanny X-Men183. Thor411.

01:23:03.230 --> 01:23:04.440
《X战警  无限》12期
X-Men Unlimited12.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.680
我一直都梦想
You know, it has always been a dream of mine...

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.400
看到你冲向我想杀我时...
to see my face reflected in your helmet...

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.740
在你的头盔上映出我自己的脸
as you charge at me with murderous intent.

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.160
我不是指现在
I don't mean right now.

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:14.720
我要马上把你撕成两半
I'm gonna rip you in half now.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:17.430
这话真有红坦克的风格
That is such a Juggernaut thing to say.

01:23:20.970 --> 01:23:25.120
天啊  我感受不到自己的腿了
Oh, my God! I can't feel my legs.

01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:26.770
我感受不到...
I can't feel...

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.770
不  腿在这里
Oh, no, they're right here.

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.140
找到了  天啊  罗素
Got 'em. God, Russell.

01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:32.320
我有自己的任务
I have a mission.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.070
复仇
To get my revenge.

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:37.610
我要活活烧死那个院长
I'm going to burn that headmaster alive.

01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:39.230
你不是复仇的料
You're not the revenge type.

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:41.250
我一个朋友是这么说的
Take it from a friend.

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:44.750
朋友  你有难的时候我保护了你
Friend? You were sick, and I protected you.

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.230
你自己亲口说的
You said it yourself.

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:50.330
"我不是你的朋友  找个更强大的人"
"I'm not your friend. Find someone stronger."

01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:51.460
所以我找了
So I did.

01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:55.380
罗素  当时我没能保护你
Russell, I couldn't protect you back then.

01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:58.860
但现在我能了  你想让我说什么
But I can now. What do you want me to say, huh?

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.390
"我在乎你"吗  真是的
"I care about you"? 'Cause goddamn it,

01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:03.150
我在乎你  罗素
I care about you, Russell.

01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:06.050
红坦克有什么我没有的
What's Juggernaut got that I don't have?

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:09.510
别说是腿  我就知道你会说是腿
Don't you say legs! I know you're gonna say legs!

01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:12.560
-腿  -听你说出来我还是很心痛
- Legs! - Still hurts to hear out loud!

01:24:14.690 --> 01:24:17.660
那是什么  那不是真绳子
What is that? That's not a real rope!

01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:19.660
你给我回来  年轻人
You get back here, young man!

01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:21.960
多米诺
Doms!

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:24.470
多米诺  带我离开  拜托
Doms, get me out of here, please.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.060
把我的胳膊当成背带
Use my arms as backpack straps.

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:30.630
我们可能找到
I think we may have found

01:24:30.630 --> 01:24:32.660
你在此的宇宙原因了
your cosmic reason for being here.

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.770
我很确定不是这个
I'm pretty sure this isn't it.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.340
X特工队
X-Force.

01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:51.660
没有没希望的孩子
No child is hopeless.

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:54.480
-别放弃那个男孩  -他怎么能就那样离开
- Don't give up on the boy. - How could he just walk away?

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.280
他眼神中充满冷漠
It was the coldness in his eyes.

01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:59.220
你应该听听他怎么说的
You should've heard it.

01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:03.760
看来家庭真的是脏话
I guess family really is an F-word.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.680
揉揉我的腿  妈妈
Rub my legs, Mama.

01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:08.350
为什么要揉你的腿
Why would I rub your legs?

01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:11.250
拜托  很疼  我这是生长痛
Please, they hurt. I have growing pains.

01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:15.470
这是...
What in the...

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.780
你的手为什么又这么小了
Why is your hand so tiny again?

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.280
那不是我的手
That's not my hand.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:23.220
苍天大地我的娘啊
Oh! Mary, mother of Joseph!

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.750
我不介意
That was nice for me.

01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:28.250
韦德  我听说车队的事了...
Wade! I heard what happened with the convoy and...

01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:34.050
你还是盖起来吧
Why wouldn't you cover that up?

01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:36.950
真正的勇士没有什么可羞耻的
A warrior has nothing to be ashamed of.

01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:39.130
但你有  你自己看看
Yeah, but you do. Look at you.

01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:41.130
你只用衬衫盖着自己的弟弟
You're just straight shirt-cocking it,

01:25:41.130 --> 01:25:42.510
跟蹒跚学步的小孩一样
toddler-style.

01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:44.410
对  完全小熊维尼风
Oh, yeah. Full Winnie the Pooh.

01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:44.410
维尼只穿上衣

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:46.500
到底怎么了  描述一下
The hell's happening? Describe it.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.850
换做我我可不会让他那么做
I wouldn't ask him to do that, if I were you.

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.510
-就是...  -好吧
- It's like, um... - Here we go.

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:50.920
就好像他在用屁眼生孩子
It's like he was giving birth anally,

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.520
但是生到一半停住了
but they quit halfway through.

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.940
腿都出来了  然后孩子说
They got the legs out, and they said,

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.080
"算了  我不想出来了"
"You know what, I'm done."

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.260
高兴了吗 就好像他腰以下是个木偶
Happy? It's like he's a Muppet from the waist down.

01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:58.970
但这次  你可以看到
But this time, you can see

01:25:58.970 --> 01:26:00.200
木偶的鸡鸡
the Muppet's dick.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.720
木偶格罗弗有个小树枝一样的老二
Grover's got a cock the size of a twig.

01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:02.860
黄鼠狼先生  我不能再被抓到并排停车了
Mr. Weasel, I can no longer be double-parked.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.410
我已经收到三张罚单了
I've had three tickets already.

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:08.670
不不不  死侍  你又来
No, no, no, DP, not again!

01:26:08.710 --> 01:26:10.190
以前这样过吗
This has happened before?

01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.740
天啊  要么吐出来  要么咽下去
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.080
你这犹豫不决快把我搞疯了
The indecision is killing me.

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.240
上帝为什么不夺走我的听力
Why couldn't God take my hearing?

01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:21.750
淡定  正在长回来
Cool your pits. They're growing back.

01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:23.570
我说得是你的脸
I'm talking about your face.

01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:25.510
我第一次见你不戴面具
I've never seen you without your mask before.

01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:27.940
-苍天  -像个牛油果
- Jesus Christ! - Looks like an avocado.

01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:29.990
不过你的腿很可爱
Your legs, though, they're cute.

01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:31.350
想借条裤子穿吗
You wanna borrow a pair of pants?

01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:34.910
很高兴大家都来了
I'm glad everybody dropped by.

01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:37.380
你们肯定好奇我什么不叫你们来
You must be wondering why I didn't call you here.

01:26:37.450 --> 01:26:39.120
我来告诉你我来的原因
I'll tell you why I'm here.

01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:41.840
"时间旅行者的妻子"的丈夫
"The Time Traveler's Wife's" husband...

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.080
差点把我揍死了
beat me within an inch of my life.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.210
他狠狠折磨了我
He was torturing me!

01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:47.440
但我就只告诉了他他想知道的所有事
But all I told him was everything he wanted to know.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.100
所以我是来帮忙做准备的
So, I'm here to help us gear up.

01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:51.860
我们好不带我去找他算账
So we can go after him without me.

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:52.560
不
No!

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.940
我一个人去
I'm doing this alone.

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:54.970
红坦克
The Juggernaut

01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.530
-会把你们都杀了  -好吧
- will kill you all. - Fair enough.

01:26:56.530 --> 01:26:58.100
再给我几个小时  让我把腿
I just need a couple of hours to get some legs

01:26:58.100 --> 01:26:59.550
-长回来  -你要怎么做
- under me. - What will you do?

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.030
我不管那孩子怎么对我
I don't care what the kid did to me.

01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:02.350
我绝不会让电索抓到他
I ain't letting Cable get to him,

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:03.950
即使我得用蛋蛋把他闷死
even if I have to teabag him to death.

01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:05.780
现在的大小只能拍拍他的脸吧
It's really just a sip of tea at this point.

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:07.930
闭嘴  黑人黑寡妇  我正文思泉涌
Zip it, black Black Widow! I'm flowing.

01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:08.790
现在的第一件事是
The first order of business is

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:10.060
把我带到电索面前
to get me in front of Cable...

01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:11.960
让我把他的血都放干
so I can pull all the fucking blood out of his body...

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.330
把他的骨头做成节日纪念品
and fashion his bones into holiday jewelry.

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:16.090
然后我会剥了他的皮
Then, I'm gonna take his skin...

01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:19.120
用来做鼓面
and stretch it out over a homemade mating drum.

01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:22.460
他就站在你们身后  是吗
He's standing right behind you, isn't he?

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.160
搞什么
What in the ass?

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.920
这间公寓的地址在约炮软件上吗
Is this apartment listed on Tinder? Grindr?

01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:39.000
你挑错地方惹事了  未来小子
You picked the wrong shithole to fuck, future boy.

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:41.800
真的有那个必要吗
Ugh. Is that really necessary?

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:47.210
不  那只是他的本能
No. It's his "Basic Instinct."

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.570
你有什么事
What can we help you with?

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.930
我是来找你求欢[建议]的
I'm here to proposition you.

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.080
苍天啊
Oh, boy!

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.550
他真是够幽默啊
He's really teeing it up, isn't he?

01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:56.650
谁来开第一个玩笑
Who gets to make the first joke?

01:27:56.650 --> 01:27:58.370
我们还是同时来吧
I think we should all do it at the same time.

01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.970
好主意
Good call.

01:27:58.970 --> 01:28:00.360
45刀给你口
For $45, you get sucky-suck.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.410
只能穿着裤子用嘴来
I only do over the pants, mouth stuff.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:05.080
-操  -《关键协议[求欢]》里盖·皮尔斯有精彩表现
- Fuck! - The Proposition has a wonderful guy Pearce performance.

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.150
等等  等等  我要自己重新来过
Wait, wait, wait! I wanna do mine over.

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:09.520
-你再说一遍  -我需要你的帮助
- Give us the line again. - I need your help!

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.260
相信我  我比你还不开心
Trust me, I'm even less happy about this than you are...

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:15.090
但你把红坦克放出来了  蠢逼
but you unleashed the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:17.160
我一个人赢不了他
I can't bring him down alone.

01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:19.120
所以只能这样了
So here we are.

01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:22.540
很不幸  我们X特工队
We're no longer accepting applications

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:24.220
不接受申请了
for X-Force, unfortunately.

01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:25.540
即使我们接受
Even if we were...

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.390
还有大风警告  要持续到至少...
there's a wind advisory in effect until at least...

01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:28.620
我们时间不多
We don't have a lot of time.

01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:30.320
你的朋友马上就开杀戒了
Your friend's about to make his first kill.

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:32.020
恕我直言  如果你知道的这么多
No offense, but if you know so much...

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.510
为什么不穿越回他是个婴儿的时候把他杀了
why not travel back to when he was a baby, kill him then?

01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:36.110
或者可以再穿越回去一点
Or better yet, head back a little further,

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:36.930
直接杀了婴儿希特勒
kill baby Hitler.

01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:39.000
我用一个设备穿越时空
I use a device to slide through time.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.710
我穿越的越久  设备就越难控制
The longer I travel, the harder it is to control.

01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:44.050
我只能充两次电  一次让我来
I got two charges: one to get me here,

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.510
一次让我回去
one to get me home.

01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:46.260
好吧
Well.

01:28:46.690 --> 01:28:48.340
这种写法也太懒了
That's just lazy writing.

01:28:48.450 --> 01:28:50.210
今晚那个男孩就要
Your boy's gonna kill the headmaster

01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:51.790
杀死孤儿院院长
of the orphanage tonight.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.850
之后他就会尝到其中的甜头
After that, he gets a real taste for it.

01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:56.730
就像十岁的克尔斯滕·邓斯特  该死
Like 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:58.150
所以他一直杀人
So he keeps killing...

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.580
一直杀啊杀啊杀
and killing, and killing,

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:01.790
杀啊杀
and killing.

01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:05.470
直到有一天他杀错了人
Until one day, he kills the wrong fucking people.

01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:08.600
我的人
My people.

01:29:12.710 --> 01:29:13.710
放松
Relax.

01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:16.580
我只是要从工具袋里拿东西
I'm retrieving something from my utility bag.

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.160
那是个该死的腰包
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.610
你很清楚  你这个变态的混蛋
and you know it, you sick son of a bitch!

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.320
这俩根本是天差地别
The difference is night and day.

01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:27.240
你让我想起我妻子
You remind me of my wife.

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:29.170
什么
I'm sorry.

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.600
-我说你让我想起我妻子  -很遗憾你这么说时
- I said, "You remind me of my wife." - No, I'm sorry that you said that...

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.500
正在跟我眼神接触  而且还涂着唇膏
while making heavy eye contact and applying lip balm.

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:35.990
她一直很挣扎
She always struggled.

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.300
但她很风趣
But she was funny...

01:29:38.490 --> 01:29:41.230
所以用幽默的三棱镜过滤自己的痛苦
and filtered her pain through the prism of humor.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.660
这我永远都学不会
Something I could never master.

01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:46.580
她的死是我的错
It was my fault she died.

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:51.400
阻止他那样的人是我的职责
It was my job to stop people like him.

01:29:52.570 --> 01:29:55.250
我有几次就快成功了
I came close a few times.

01:29:58.410 --> 01:30:00.330
他对此不太高兴
He wasn't too happy about that.

01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:03.250
他想伤害我
He was trying to hurt me...

01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:05.450
他也知道应该怎么做
and he knew exactly how to do it.

01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:10.870
赐福于那些
Blessed are the wicked

01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:13.060
被我所治愈的邪恶之人
who are healed by my hand.

01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:17.480
他来到我家
He came into my home...

01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:20.960
带走了唯一让那成为家的东西
and took the only thing that made it a home.

01:30:25.210 --> 01:30:26.580
听起来熟悉吗
Sound familiar?

01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.630
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:31.140
真的很遗憾
No, I'm really sorry.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.510
但那不是罗素
But that isn't Russell.

01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:37.320
-他可以不成为那样  -如果你知道我知道的...
- It doesn't have to be him. - If you knew what I knew...

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.100
他是有愤怒问题
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.930
还有点轻微学习障碍
maybe a small learning disability...

01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:42.280
严重糖尿病
splash of diabetes...

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:43.490
但那都是可以处理好的
but nothing that can't be fixed.

01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:44.970
如果你能穿越回去
If you could go back...

01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:48.420
阻止杀你女朋友的人  你会去做吗
and stop the people that took your girl, would you?

01:30:48.570 --> 01:30:49.430
不
No.

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:51.440
我会请他们去嫖一顿
I'd buy them all a bouquet of hand jobs.

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.520
废话  我当然会
Of course I fucking would!

01:30:54.130 --> 01:30:54.890
但我不会杀一个小孩子
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:57.410
我没让你杀小孩子
I'm not asking you to kill a kid!

01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:58.980
我会杀他
I'll kill the kid.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:02.230
我是让你拯救成千上万其他孩子
I'm asking you to save hundreds of other kids.

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.590
罗素会烧毁那个孤儿院
Russell's gonna burn down that orphanage.

01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:06.920
我可以想象你死去的女朋友
And I can imagine your dead girlfriend...

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:09.180
肯定想让你做对的事  对吧
would want you to do the right thing, wouldn't she?

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.940
什么是对的事  帅哥
So, what's it gonna be, handsome?

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.060
给我个机会拯救他
Give me a chance to save him.

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:16.630
-什么  -你说...
- What? - You said...

01:31:16.630 --> 01:31:18.450
他一旦开杀戒  就会尝到甜头
once he kills someone, he gets a taste for it.

01:31:18.450 --> 01:31:20.330
如果我们在他开杀戒前找到他...
If we can get to him before that happens...

01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:22.660
答应我  你会给我机会
promise you'll give me a chance

01:31:22.690 --> 01:31:24.210
让他走上不同的路
to put him on a different path.

01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:25.610
定义一下"机会"
Define "Chance."

01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:26.990
我不知道   要救一个人的灵魂
I don't know. How long does it take

01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:28.110
需要多久  那不是...
to save someone's soul? That's not...

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.360
我给你30秒
I'll give you 30 seconds.

01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:31.570
-不行  -这是最多了
- What? No! - Best I can do.

01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:32.710
不要这个机会就算了
Take it or leave it.

01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:44.870
他站起来了
He's doing it!

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.080
看那个小家伙  他站起来了
Look at the little fella. He's doing it.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.220
他来了
There he goes.

01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:49.960
苍天啊
Jesus Christ!

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:51.620
用衬衫盖着呢
Just shirt-cocking it.

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:54.910
好样的  小家伙
There you go, little fella.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.070
加油  你做得很好
Go on, you're doing it!

01:31:57.490 --> 01:32:00.540
我漂亮  没毛  蹒跚学步的小男孩
My beautiful, hairless, Twizzler-legged baby boy.

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:03.680
苍天
Christ!

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.210
不忍直视
That's disturbing.

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:06.410
30秒
30 seconds.

01:32:12.090 --> 01:32:13.540
-成交  -成交
- Deal. - Deal.

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.620
太烦了  他们竟然没有你的尺码
Man, that sucks they didn't have anything in your size.

01:32:21.130 --> 01:32:30.440
大码先生

01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:24.730
我真的想跟你穿得很搭
I really wanted to match, you know?

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.580
作为一个恶人小队
Being a menacing team.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.570
真是糟糕透了
Oh, man, it sucks.

01:32:28.570 --> 01:32:30.980
确实很让人不爽  孩子
That was some cold-ass shit, kid.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.310
那只是前列腺高潮的
And that is just the first five steps

01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:36.140
前五个步骤
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.550
我们这是去哪里
Where the hell are we going?

01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:39.790
你自己说的
You said it yourself.

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.840
没人能阻止红坦克  所以我们需要帮助
Nothing can stop the Juggernaut. We need backup.

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:45.490
我会在你敌人的血中沐浴
I will bathe in the blood of your enemies.

01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.710
能把音乐关掉吗
Can you turn off the music?

01:32:52.670 --> 01:32:54.160
不可以
You'll do no such thing.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.830
你为什么不用印度口音说
Why don't you just say it in an Indian accent?

01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:58.570
-什么[不好意思]  -接受道歉
- I'm sorry? - Apology accepted.

01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:00.590
我不喜欢你这一点
This is a side of you I do not like.

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:01.260
我猜猜
Let me guess,

01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:03.640
你在未来的某个兄弟是印度人
some of your best friends in the future are Indian.

01:33:03.650 --> 01:33:04.150
你到底在...
What the hell are you...?

01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:06.380
不宽容又一次抬起了丑陋的头
Once again, intolerance rears its ugly head.

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:07.580
抱歉  会好起来的
I am so sorry. It gets better.

01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:09.770
我不是种族主义者  白痴
I'm not a fucking racist, moron!

01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:11.760
种族主义者就会这么说
That's precisely what a racist would say.

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.900
这次我挺这个白人家伙
I'm with the old white guy on this one.

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:14.740
这是一大转变
And that's a twist.

01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:15.640
等事情结束
When this is over...

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:18.000
我会拿你断掉的脚把你插死
I'm going to fuck you to death with your own broken feet.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.520
还有性虐待倾向  你真牛逼
And a sexual predator, too. That's rich.

01:33:20.530 --> 01:33:21.690
我该念完大学的
I should have finished college.

01:33:21.690 --> 01:33:23.890
话说你在未来到底是干什么的
So what exactly do you do in the future, anyway, huh?

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:25.200
某种战士吗
Some kind of soldier?

01:33:25.450 --> 01:33:27.310
差不多吧
Yeah, something like that.

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.570
我曾是特种部队战士
I was a soldier. Special Forces.

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:32.240
五十年后我们肯定会成为好哥们
I bet 50 years from now, we're bestest buddies.

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.350
五十年后你早死了
50 years from now, you're very dead.

01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:37.560
你们这一代把这个星球搞死了
Your entire generation fucked this planet into a coma.

01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:39.670
剧透警告
Spoiler alert.

01:33:41.490 --> 01:33:42.370
星球啊
Planets.

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.100
下次还是打优步吧
Next time, Uber.

01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.300
我给你剧透一点
Here's a spoiler alert.

01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:48.210
你不是英雄
You're not a fucking hero.

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:51.930
你只是个穿成性玩具的烦人小丑
You're just an annoying clown dressed up as a sex toy.

01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:53.600
我有消息告诉你
Well, I got news for you.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.200
我的心放对了地方
My heart is in the right place.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.700
罗素不会杀任何人
Russell's not gonna kill anyone.

01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:59.020
因为我  他会知道真正的爱是什么
Because of me, he's gonna know what real love looks like.

01:33:59.020 --> 01:33:59.780
我们都会死
We're all going to die.

01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:00.690
因为你  我会一直知道
Because of you, I'll always know

01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:03.060
成年人长了婴儿蛋是什么样
what a grown man with baby balls looks like.

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:05.380
我会变大的  又不是大不起来
I'm a grower, not a shower.

01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:06.560
天啊  真希望这是公交车
God, I wish this were a bus

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:07.910
那样我就可以按铃下车了
where I could pull the string and get out.

01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:09.690
还好开车的不是电索
It's a good thing Cable's not driving,

01:34:09.690 --> 01:34:10.760
否则你就坐后排了
or you'd be in the back.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.800
-我本来就坐后排  -这里
- I am in the back. - Right here!

01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:32.880
我错了
I made mistakes!

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.970
我想收回
I wanna take them back!

01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:38.360
你信任过我  我将那份信任
You trusted me. I took that trust...

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.360
变成了机场卫生间里的一个鸟洞
and turned it into a glory hole in an airport bathroom.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.360
厕所隔板上用于口交的孔

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:44.270
就是明尼阿波利斯那个  你知道的
The one in Minneapolis. You know the one.

01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:47.370
但连你都知道我不是个十足的混蛋
But even you know I'm not a complete piece of shit.

01:34:47.370 --> 01:34:48.920
我曾经是X战警
I was once an X-Man.

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.000
实习生
Trainee!

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.860
你还在用我的尼龙搭扣标签啊
You're still using my Velcro labels. Aw.

01:34:57.370 --> 01:34:58.840
确实比胶带更好用
They do stick better than tape.

01:34:58.840 --> 01:34:59.930
你好  韦德
Hi, Wade!

01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.610
别这样
Please don't.

01:35:00.610 --> 01:35:03.690
你想说什么就说吧  快点
Say whatever it is you're here to say. Make it quick.

01:35:03.690 --> 01:35:04.810
好  快
Right. Quick.

01:35:04.810 --> 01:35:06.960
就是那个孩子  就像你  我也让他失望了
It's the kid. Just like you, I let him down.

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:07.800
就像我
And just like me,

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.550
从没有人为他牺牲过
he's never had anyone sacrifice anything for him...

01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:10.540
因为全世界很久以前
because the whole world wrote him off

01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:12.030
就把他当成垃圾放弃了
as a piece of shit a long time ago.

01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:14.150
他现在跟红坦克组队了
Look, he's teamed up with the Juggernaut!

01:35:14.210 --> 01:35:15.720
红坦克
The Juggernaut!

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.360
那是我最喜欢的漫威角色
Who's, like, my favorite Marvel character ever...

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.740
你好  雪绪  谢谢你跟我打招呼
And hi, Yukio! That was really nice of you to say hi...

01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:20.780
所以我也跟你打个招呼
so I'm saying hi back.

01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:22.340
你们在一起真般配
You guys make a super cute couple.

01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:24.010
真的  我说到哪里了
Yeah. Where was I?

01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:25.800
想起来了  永远不该见自己的偶像
Oh, yeah. You should never meet your heroes...

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.600
因为说真的  他有点混蛋
because, honestly, he's a bit of a dick!

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.340
跟大多数混蛋一样  他坚硬无比
And like a lot of dicks, he's hard as a rock...

01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:30.770
而且只会惹麻烦
and causes nothing but problems!

01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:33.950
你可以阻止红坦克  我知道你可以
Look, you can stop the Juggernaut. I know you can.

01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:36.840
你知道如果我帮你  我会是什么下场吗
Do you know what would happen to me if I helped you?

01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:39.290
我会丢脸
I would be disgraced.

01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:41.450
你是个犯罪分子  逃犯
You are a criminal, a fugitive.

01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:42.760
但最糟糕的是
But worst of all...

01:35:43.090 --> 01:35:44.860
你让我心碎了  韦德
you broke my heart, Wade.

01:35:46.210 --> 01:35:46.800
那你知道吗
Then you know what?

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:49.130
你的心没放对位置  大块头
Your heart's in the wrong place, big guy.

01:35:50.230 --> 01:35:53.060
做正确的事有时候会很操蛋
Doing the right thing is sometimes messy...

01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:56.730
完球  而且不会很方便
and fucked up, and not particularly convenient!

01:35:56.730 --> 01:35:59.530
所以你就待在你的处女城堡里吧
So stay here in Chateau de Virgin...

01:35:59.530 --> 01:36:01.750
我们去嗨了
while we go get our fuck on!

01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:06.270
你表现得很好
You're doing great.

01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:13.490
你戴着头盔是因为
So you wear that helmet because

01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:15.140
你兄弟想读你的心吗
your brother tries to read your mind?

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:18.550
对  不过他现在坐轮椅了  我们扯平了
Yeah, but he's in a wheelchair, so even-steven.

01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:21.230
有人来了  是罗素  先生
Someone's coming. It's Russell, sir.

01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:22.430
而且他不是一个人
And he's not alone.

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:25.050
保证孩子们的安全
Secure the children.

01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:29.400
他们不会取代我们的
They will not replace us.

01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:32.190
我们去大干一场如何
What do you say we go fuck some shit up?

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:36.740
"我们去大干一场"就是我的中间名
"Let's fuck some shit up" is my legal middle name.

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.750
你给我断后  我对付那个老头子
Watch my back. I've got the old man.

01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:44.660
阿门  兄弟
Amen, brother.

01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:52.360
是时候嗨起来了
Time to make the chimichangas.

01:36:52.450 --> 01:36:53.630
30秒
30 seconds.

01:36:54.810 --> 01:36:56.620
我终于知道为什么来此了
I finally know why I'm here.

01:36:57.290 --> 01:36:58.900
我是在这里被抚养长大的
I was raised in this place.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.730
其实不是抚养  而是折磨
Well, not raised. I was tortured.

01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:04.420
震惊  你来此的宇宙原因大白天下了
Wow! It's your cosmic reason for being here.

01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:05.920
-走吧  -肯定会很好玩
- Shall we? - This is gonna be fun.

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:06.910
是啊
Yeah!

01:37:07.050 --> 01:37:08.190
我一直想问你
Hey! Been meaning to ask you...

01:37:08.190 --> 01:37:11.280
你为什么带着那个脏兮兮的恶心玩具熊
what's with the dirty, disgusting hobo bear?

01:37:11.690 --> 01:37:14.330
那不是弄脏了  是我死去女儿的血
It's not dirt. It's the blood of my dead daughter.

01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:17.520
你是熊吗[你在吗]  上帝  我是玛格丽特
Are You Bear, God? It's Me, Margaret.

01:37:17.710 --> 01:37:18.830
来顶个拳
Give me some.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.870
俗话说笑声治愈一切
They say laughter heals anything...

01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:21.950
当然  除了那个
except, of course, that.

01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:23.370
应该打开音乐了
We should just cue the music.

01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:51.530
欢迎回家  罗素  我们很想你
Welcome home, Russell. We missed you.

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:53.480
罗素
Russell!

01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:55.800
你不用这样  我们谈谈
You don't need to do this! Let's talk!

01:37:56.690 --> 01:37:58.470
你为什么穿成炸弹客的样子
Why are you dressed like the Unabomber?

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:04.510
-这就是原因  -我早说过  这个小混蛋无药可救了
- That's why! - Told you this little fucker's too far gone.

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.110
闭嘴  灭霸  我们说好了的  你...
Zip it, Thanos! We have a deal and you fuck...

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.110
乔什·布洛林也是灭霸的饰演者

01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:13.140
我要把那个出租车司机插进你的菊花里
I'm gonna shove that cab driver right up your ass.

01:38:13.730 --> 01:38:15.770
我的身体和手都很柔软
My body and my hands are so soft.

01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:18.880
-你还是回车上吧  -我还是回车上吧
- You should probably head back to the car. - I think I'll head back to the car.

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.980
扣动扳机的时候  枪才最好用
It works best when you pull the trigger.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:26.890
这把枪太赞了
That gun is amazing!

01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:29.310
说出来
Say it!

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:34.770
你是个怪胎
You are an abomination!

01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:45.240
现在我要把红色家伙插进这个老家伙菊花里
Now, I'm gonna shove the red guy up the old guy.

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:47.730
我相信他的话  分散战斗
I believe him! Every man for themselves!

01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:53.300
逮住你了
Gotcha!

01:38:53.850 --> 01:38:55.340
受死吧  侏儒
Beat it, midget!

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.110
黑寡妇安抚浩克的台词

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.110
大家伙  太阳快下山了
Hey, big guy, the sun's getting real low!

01:39:01.110 --> 01:39:02.640
惨了
Oh, shit fuck!

01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:17.600
过来  美人
Come here, beautiful.

01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:36.810
说出来
Say it!

01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:01.670
你为我而来了
You came for me.

01:41:01.670 --> 01:41:03.010
我不会放弃你的
I'm not giving up on you,

01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:05.180
你也不要放弃那个男孩
and you are not giving up on that boy.

01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:07.310
谁说的规矩不是用来破坏的
Who says that rules aren't meant to be broken?

01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:09.750
是时候用脏的了
It's time to fight dirty.

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:11.200
是时候用扫堂腿了  强尼
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:14.100
喂  挑个跟自己个头差不多的人欺负
Hey! Pick on someone your own size!

01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:16.060
这话真是你的风格
That's such a you thing to say!

01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:17.930
去干掉他  猛虎
Go get him, tiger!

01:41:18.090 --> 01:41:20.510
特效打斗场面登场了
Big CGI fight coming up!

01:41:42.970 --> 01:41:44.060
他完全没问题
He's doing great.

01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:45.170
说出来
Say it!

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:51.240
-罗素  -对了
- Russell. - Bingo!

01:41:56.770 --> 01:41:58.150
看到那辆巴士了吗
You see that bus?

01:41:58.530 --> 01:42:00.570
我要把它插进你菊花里
I'm gonna shove it up your ass.

01:42:03.110 --> 01:42:05.770
没错  我要用脏的了
That's right! I'm fighting dirty!

01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:08.010
-好极了  -那些怪胎在那里
- Oh, great! - There they are! Those freaks!

01:42:08.010 --> 01:42:10.800
一群穿着护士鞋的武装恋童癖
A bunch of armed pedophiles in nursing shoes.

01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:12.320
能给我一把枪吗
Can I have one of those guns?

01:42:13.110 --> 01:42:14.400
-不能  -好吧
- No. - That's fine.

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.690
赶紧滚  变种人渣
Get off this property, mutant scum!

01:42:16.690 --> 01:42:18.300
那我就用这块砖头吧
I'm just gonna use this brick.

01:42:18.490 --> 01:42:19.790
尽力而为
Maximum effort.

01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:27.750
谁说再也没法回家了呢
Who says you can't go home again?

01:42:47.890 --> 01:42:48.870
说出来
Say it.

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:52.710
你每次折磨我时说的话  说出来
Say what you said every time you tortured me!

01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:54.110
说出来
Say it!

01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:57.880
赐福于那些被我所治愈的邪恶之人
Blessed are the wicked who are healed by my hand!

01:42:58.570 --> 01:43:00.140
赐福于那些
Blessed are the wicked...

01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:02.060
被我所治愈的
who are healed...

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:03.890
邪恶之人
by my hand.

01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:24.350
你个共产主义混蛋
You commie motherfucker!

01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:52.480
天啊  你也感受到了吗
Oh, my God. Did you feel that, too?

01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:55.990
只有好哥们才一起处决恋童癖
Only best buddies execute pedophiles together.

01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:00.790
你有30秒  你个叨逼叨逼碎碎念
You got 30 seconds, you jabbering butt plug!

01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:02.180
你终于上道了
Now we're getting it.

01:44:06.570 --> 01:44:08.630
我需要一辆巴士把你们都救出去
I need a bus to get you all out of here.

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.370
孤儿们
Orphans.

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:17.630
天啊
Oh, geez.

01:44:19.150 --> 01:44:21.290
是时候为你的行为
It's time to burn for

01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:24.620
-付出代价了  -一个孩子不该有这种力量
- what you've done! - A child should not be burdened with such power!

01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:34.520
罗素  等等
Russell! Wait!

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:50.720
等等  他还没杀人
Wait! He hasn't killed anyone yet!

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:53.140
-你还要等到什么时候  -你他妈不许动他
- What more do you need to see? - Don't you fucking dare!

01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:54.220
他只是个孩子
He's just a kid!

01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:56.490
滴答  计时中
Tick, tock. Meter's running!

01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:11.810
我要把你化了  做成屌环
I'm gonna melt you down and make a cock ring.

01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:34.960
-我说过了  走开  -来啊
- I told you! Leave me alone! - Come on!

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.280
听我说
Listen to me!

01:46:00.250 --> 01:46:02.860
那是我们俄罗斯的做法
That's how we do it in Mother Russia.

01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:07.490
大家都说千禧一代是最难搞的
They say millennials are the hardest to reach.

01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:12.010
不  你做得太棒了
Oh, no. You're doing amazing.

01:46:13.530 --> 01:46:16.350
该死  做流氓的感觉真好
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta!

01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:17.870
回家吧  韦德
Go home, Wade!

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:20.060
你在毁掉一切
You're ruining everything!

01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:26.940
我越来越擅长这个了
I'm getting good at this shit.

01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:28.300
快走  快走  快走
Go, go, go!

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.310
他今晚死定了  韦德
He dies tonight, Wade.

01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:35.090
你阻止不了我
You can't stop me!

01:46:35.770 --> 01:46:37.960
他跑得像个变态一样
He even runs like a fucking pervert.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:40.680
像丢失了笔记本电脑的网络猎人
Like an online predator who lost his laptop.

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:43.480
那把枪只剩一发子弹了
There's one bullet left in that gun.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.560
等等  等等  稍等一下
Wait, wait, wait! Please, just give me a second!

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:46.580
我来搞定
I got this.

01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:49.360
-罗素  -后退  回家吧  韦德
- Russell! - Stay back! Go home, Wade!

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:51.600
我们谈谈吧  不用这样
Let's talk. It doesn't have to go this way!

01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.460
那坨狗屎...
That piece of shit...

01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:55.650
他对你做出那种事  确实死有余辜
he deserves to die for what he did to you.

01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:59.250
他伤害了你  让你也想伤害别人
He hurt you badly. Makes you wanna hurt others.

01:46:59.930 --> 01:47:01.690
但是如果你杀了他  他就赢了
But if you kill him, he wins.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:04.760
你就成了他口中的那样  而且更坏
You become everything he says you are, but worse.

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.870
你只是个孩子
You're just a kid.

01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:09.050
你不想伤害任何人
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:10.900
你怎么知道我的想法
How do you know what I want?

01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:12.430
因为我一直在你心里
Because I've been inside you.

01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:14.450
我说错了
That came out wrong.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.750
我一直在处于你的位置[在你鞋子里]
I've been inside your shoes.

01:47:16.750 --> 01:47:18.580
这样说也不合适
Which is also off-putting.

01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:20.150
这不是个很好的类比
It's not a great analogy.

01:47:20.210 --> 01:47:21.400
重点是...
The point is...

01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:23.240

评判一个人
not by the color of their skin,
