卖笑的一天又开始了
Another day in chuckle town.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.220
你没事吧
You okay?

15:59.420 --> 16:01.490
我听说你被人打了
I heard about the beat-down you took.

16:02.620 --> 16:03.920
太野蛮了
Fucking savages.

16:05.220 --> 16:08.290
只是一群孩子罢了  我不该理会他们的
It was just a bunch of kids. I should've left them alone.

16:08.290 --> 16:11.060
不  那样的话他们会抢走你的一切
No, they'll take everything from you if you do that.

16:11.450 --> 16:14.290
外面发生的那些破事  他们都是畜生
All the crazy shit out there? They're animals.

16:19.450 --> 16:20.320
这样吧
You know what?

16:26.160 --> 16:26.990
给你
Here.

16:28.820 --> 16:29.690
这是什么
What is it?

16:30.450 --> 16:31.190

Take it.

16:32.420 --> 16:33.350
给你的
It's for you.

16:38.090 --> 16:39.890
你得保护好自己
You gotta protect yourself out there,

16:40.720 --> 16:42.250
不然你会很惨
otherwise you're gonna get fucked.

16:43.850 --> 16:44.790
兰德尔
Randall.

16:46.420 --> 16:48.990
我不应该持枪
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.190
别担心  亚瑟
Don't sweat it, Art.

16:52.850 --> 16:54.120
没人会知道的
No one has to know.

16:54.220 --> 16:56.290
你可以以后再回报我
And you can pay me back some other time.

16:56.820 --> 16:58.190
你知道我罩着你
You know you're my boy.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.650
亚瑟  霍伊特让你到办公室找他

盖瑞  你知道我一直好奇什么吗
Hey, Garry, you know what I've always wondered?

17:06.750 --> 17:07.820
不知道
No idea.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.690
迷你高尔夫对你们来说  是不是标准高尔夫
Do you people call it miniature golf, or is it just golf to you?

17:16.760 --> 17:18.250
揍他老二  盖瑞
Punch him in the dick, Garry.

17:30.730 --> 17:32.760
办公室

17:35.120 --> 17:36.190
你好  霍伊特
Hello, Hoyt.

17:36.850 --> 17:39.220
盖瑞让我来找你
Garry said you wanted to see me?

17:39.650 --> 17:40.700
你的喜剧生涯如何了
How's the comedy career?

17:40.900 --> 17:42.550
你现在是着名单口相声演员了吗
You're a famous stand-up yet?

17:42.760 --> 17:43.820
并不是
Not quite.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.990
我还在构思段子
Just been working on my material.

17:45.990 --> 17:47.920
别坐了  很快就好
No, don't sit. This will be quick.

17:48.090 --> 17:50.250
听着  我喜欢你  亚瑟
Look. I like you, Arthur.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.090
这里很多人都觉得你是个怪胎
You know, lot of the guys here think you're a freak,

17:52.090 --> 17:53.250
但我喜欢你
but I like you.

17:53.820 --> 17:55.390
我甚至不知道为什么喜欢你
I don't even know why I like you.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.420
但我又收到投诉了
But I got another complaint.

17:58.490 --> 18:01.020
让我有点生气了  肯尼乐器行的人
And it's starting to piss me off. Kenny's Music.

18:01.350 --> 18:03.120
说你消失了
The guy said you disappeared.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.250
连广告牌都没还回去
Never even returned his sign.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.820
因为我被人抢了
Because I got jumped.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.090
你没听说吗
Didn't you hear?

18:09.760 --> 18:10.790
就为一块广告牌吗
For a sign?

18:11.620 --> 18:14.020
扯淡  没道理啊
It's bullshit. It doesn't make sense,

18:14.290 --> 18:16.020
把广告牌还回去
just give him his sign back.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.590
他们都要倒闭了  亚瑟
He's going out of business for God's sake, Arthur.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.550
我要广告牌做什么
Why would I keep that sign?

18:20.790 --> 18:23.290
我他妈怎么知道  问我干嘛
How the fuck do I know? Why does anybody do anything?

18:24.760 --> 18:26.690
你如果不把广告牌还回去
If you don't return the sign,

18:26.790 --> 18:28.960
我只能从你的工资里扣了
I got to take it out of your pay check.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.190
清楚了吗
Are we clear?

18:32.760 --> 18:36.150
听着  我是在帮你  知道吗
Listen, I'm trying to help you. Okay?

18:36.150 --> 18:37.690
还有件事
Now I tell you something else.

18:37.690 --> 18:41.290
别的员工觉得跟你待在一起不自在  亚瑟
The other guys, they don't feel comfortable around you, Arthur.

18:41.350 --> 18:43.850
因为他们觉得你是个怪胎  懂吗
Because people think you're weird, okay?

18:43.850 --> 18:45.820
我不能放任不管
And I can't have that around me.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.250
我希望把这事解决了
I want it-I want it to work out---

19:35.720 --> 19:37.890
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

19:41.490 --> 19:42.250
谢谢
Thank you.

20:04.590 --> 20:06.860
这栋楼太烂了  对吧
This building is so awful, isn't it?

20:09.060 --> 20:11.850
这栋楼太烂了  对吗  妈妈
This building is so awful, right, mommy?

20:11.850 --> 20:14.250

Yeah, sweetie. I hear you, GiGi.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.960
太烂了  妈妈
It's so awful, mommy.

20:18.420 --> 20:19.860
对吗  妈妈
Right, mommy?

20:27.260 --> 20:29.390
-晚安  -这栋楼太烂了  对吗
- Goodnight. - This building's so awful, isn't it?

20:43.290 --> 20:44.090
走吧
Come on.

21:03.790 --> 21:04.550
抬头
Head up.

21:05.150 --> 21:07.090
可能是邮递员把信丢了
Maybe the mailman is throwing them away.

21:07.420 --> 21:09.520
妈妈  为什么这些信对你这么重要
Mom, why are these letters so important to you?

21:11.150 --> 21:13.720
-他收到信又会怎样呢  -他会帮我们
- What do you think he's gonna do? - He's gonna help us.

21:14.790 --> 21:16.690
你为他们工作
You worked for them, what?

21:17.460 --> 21:18.990
是三十年前的事情了吧
30 years ago?

21:19.020 --> 21:20.550
他为什么要帮我们
Why would he help us?

21:21.060 --> 21:23.490
因为托马斯·韦恩是个好人
Because Thomas Wayne is a good man.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.620
如果他知道我们现在生活得这么困难
If he knew how we were living,

21:27.320 --> 21:30.250
如果他看到这间屋子  他会很难过
if he saw this place, it would make him sick.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.290
我只能这么跟你解释了
I can't explain it to you any better than that.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.820
我不想让你操心钱的事
I don't want you worrying about money.

21:39.850 --> 21:40.890
或是操心我
Or me.

21:41.490 --> 21:45.590
大家都说我已经能给大俱乐部表演单口相声了
Everybody's telling me that my stand-up is ready for the big clubs.

21:46.620 --> 21:49.290
但是  开心  谁让你这么觉得的
But, Happy, what makes you think you could do that?

21:49.720 --> 21:51.220
-什么意思  -我是说
- What do you mean? - I mean...

21:52.690 --> 21:54.690
要当喜剧演员  难道不需要足够幽默吗
don't you have to be funny to be a comedian?

22:58.560 --> 22:59.990
你叫什么
Hey, what's your name?

23:00.990 --> 23:01.990
亚瑟

那谁跳得不好
And who is not?

23:10.290 --> 23:11.020
他
Him.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.590
开心  什么声音  你没事吧
Happy! What was that? Are you okay?

23:18.590 --> 23:19.790
妈妈  你说什么
Mom, what?

23:19.790 --> 23:21.950
刚刚的响声  你听到了吗
That noise! Did you hear that noise?

23:21.960 --> 23:24.460
我在看老战争片
I'm-I'm watching an old war movie!

23:24.590 --> 23:26.120
调小声点
Turn it down!

23:32.290 --> 23:33.590
抱歉  妈妈
Sorry, mom.

23:47.060 --> 23:47.820
行了吧
You good?

25:13.850 --> 25:15.350
我来告诉你们情境
So I tell you how I operate.

25:15.350 --> 25:18.190
我是新英格兰地区一所着名大学的教授
I'm a professor at a prestigious New England university.

25:19.650 --> 25:23.490
我妻子是我的西方文明导论课上的大四学生
And my wife is a senior in my intro to western civ.

25:25.590 --> 25:28.920
我知道  为什么她大四了还上导论课
I know, I know, why is she-why is she a senior in intro?

25:28.920 --> 25:30.460
我当时也纳闷
I didn't buy it either.

25:31.190 --> 25:33.320
她在我的办公时间来找我
So she comes to me during my office hours,

25:34.190 --> 25:35.920
周一和周三的三点到五点
Monday and Wednesday 3:00 to 5:00,

25:35.920 --> 25:38.120
她说  "打扰一下  路易斯教授"
and she says, "Excuse me, Professor Lewis."

25:38.290 --> 25:40.440
在这个学校里我没法用真的姓氏
I can't use my real last name at this collage

25:40.440 --> 25:41.990
因为他们不雇犹太人
'cause they don't hire Jews.

25:43.850 --> 25:46.790
我要是获得终身教席就有这个问题  先不管这个
Something I'll address once I have a tenure, but for now...

25:47.760 --> 25:49.290
她说  "路易斯教授
She says, "Excuse me, Professor Lewis.

25:49.290 --> 25:51.920
我觉得我的西方文明导论可能要挂科了
I think I might be in danger of failing intro to western civ,

25:51.920 --> 25:55.090
我想让你知道  为了不挂科我什么都愿意做"
and I just want you to know I'm willing to do anything to pass."

25:55.490 --> 25:59.250
我说"什么都愿意做吗"  她说"爽"
I said "anything?", and she says "Aah".

25:55.690 --> 26:01.360
保持目光接触
记得观察好笑的事
性笑话总能使观众笑

26:01.410 --> 26:04.990
心理疾病

26:35.320 --> 26:38.350
人们

26:43.960 --> 26:48.060
人们希望你

26:51.650 --> 26:59.920
有心理疾病最糟的是
人们希望你假装没病

27:08.790 --> 27:10.160

Were you following me today?

27:13.850 --> 27:14.660

I was hoping you'd come in and rob the place.

27:24.650 --> 27:25.890

28:56.820 --> 28:58.820

Nothing. I---

32:02.710 --> 32:04.590
我...我有一种病
I have a--- I have a condition.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.910
我来告诉你你有什么  混球
I'll tell you what you have, asshole.

32:10.470 --> 32:11.850
拜托  住手
Please, stop!

32:13.700 --> 32:17.160
还会踢人  把他抱住  把他抱住
We've got a kicker, huh? Hey, hold him steady, hold him steady.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.740
别起来  怪胎
Stay down, freak!

32:32.770 --> 32:35.440
不  不
No! No!

32:40.030 --> 32:42.810
救命  救命
Hey! Help! Help!

33:13.860 --> 33:15.430
请远离正在关闭的车门
Stay clear of the closing doors.

33:52.580 --> 33:53.270
该死
Shit.

33:54.760 --> 33:55.600
该死
Shit.

36:48.460 --> 36:50.540
我看报道说是画了满脸妆的人干的
I read it was a guy in full make-up.

36:50.540 --> 36:53.360
不  这里说他戴了面具
No, it says right here it was a mask.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.530
不管怎样  我觉得这对生意有好处
Either way, I think it's good for business.

36:55.530 --> 36:57.880
所有报纸的头版都是小丑
They got clowns in front of every newspaper.

36:58.030 --> 36:59.680
大个儿  有什么好消息吗
Big man, what's the good word?

37:03.550 --> 37:05.890
亚瑟  我听说了你的遭遇
Hey, Arthur. I heard what happened.

37:06.190 --> 37:07.120
我很遗憾  伙计
Sorry, mate.

37:07.840 --> 37:10.470
是啊  那样被开除
Yeah, it doesn't seem fair,

37:10.520 --> 37:12.120
感觉并不公平
you get fired like that.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.030
你真的带枪去儿童医院了吗  亚瑟
Did you really bring a gun to the children's hospital, Arty?

37:17.290 --> 37:18.800
你他妈为什么要那么做
What the fuck would you do that for?

37:18.870 --> 37:20.260
这是你新表演的一部分吗  亚瑟
Is that part of your new act, Arthur?

37:20.260 --> 37:21.460
如果你的舞蹈没把人逗笑
If your dancing doesn't do the trick,

37:21.460 --> 37:22.820
你就开枪自杀吗
you just gonna shoot yourself?

37:24.170 --> 37:26.020
怎么不问问兰德尔
Why don't you ask Randall about it?

37:26.530 --> 37:27.820
是他的枪
It was his gun.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.050
-什么  -为此我还欠你人情  不是吗
- What? - I still owe you for that, don't I?

37:31.050 --> 37:32.750
你他妈在说什么
What the fuck are you talking about?

37:33.250 --> 37:35.310
别胡扯了  亚瑟
Stop talking outta your ass, Art!

37:40.420 --> 37:41.500
不
Oh, no!

37:43.340 --> 37:44.920
我忘了打卡下班了
I forgot to punch out.

37:56.850 --> 38:02.500
别忘了笑

38:03.220 --> 38:14.390
别笑

38:15.200 --> 38:18.960
我们的城市正试图弄清楚
And as our city tries to make sense of the brutal

38:18.960 --> 38:21.230
上周在地铁上发生的三人命案
triple murder on the subway last week.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.000
我们请来了托马斯·韦恩
We're joined by Thomas Wayne.

38:23.010 --> 38:25.090
-开心  托马斯·韦恩上电视了  -他跟这起悲剧
- Happy, look. Thomas Wayne's on TV. - He has a personal connection

38:25.090 --> 38:26.910
-有私人关联  -听到了  妈妈
- this tragedy. - Yes, mother.

38:26.910 --> 38:28.090
感谢邀请我参加节目
Thanks for having me on show.

38:28.090 --> 38:30.960
他们在问他那个可怕的地铁谋杀案
They're asking him about those horrible subway murders.

38:31.190 --> 38:34.430
谢谢你  托马斯  我知道这对你来说并不容易
Thank you, Thomas. I know this is a difficult time for you.

38:34.430 --> 38:36.310
-为什么问他  -这些年轻人都是...
- Why him? - These young men all were...

38:36.310 --> 38:37.760
像是在给竞选造势
Looks like his compaign.

38:38.570 --> 38:40.800
是的  他们三个都是韦恩投资公司的员工
Yes, all three of them worked for Wayne Investments.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.300
托马斯·韦恩

38:40.890 --> 38:42.550
他们善良  正直  有教养
Good, decent, educated,

38:42.550 --> 38:45.790
尽管我与他们三人没有私交
although, I didn't know any of them personally.

38:46.850 --> 38:48.940
和所有在韦恩公司工作过或正在工作的员工一样
Like all the Wayne employees, past and present,

38:50.010 --> 38:50.960
他们都是我的家人
they were family.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.100
-听到了吧  我就说我们是一家人  -这座城市
- You hear that! I told you. We're family. - There now seems to be a

38:53.100 --> 38:56.810
现在似乎仇富情绪高涨
groundswell of anti-rich sentiment in the city.

38:56.810 --> 38:59.320
似乎那些不那么富裕的市民
It's almost as if our less fortunate residents

38:59.320 --> 39:01.160
选择站在凶手这边
are taken the side of the killer.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.660
是的  令人遗憾
Yes and it's a shame.

39:02.980 --> 39:05.910
这也是我考虑参选市长的其中一个原因
It's one of the reasons why I'm considering a run for mayor.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.160
高谭市迷失了方向
Gotham has lost its way.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.300
你对于有目击者声称
What about the eyewitness report

39:10.310 --> 39:13.280
嫌疑人戴着小丑面具有什么看法
of the suspect being a man in a clown mask?

39:13.570 --> 39:15.330
我觉得很合理
Well, it makes total sense to me.

39:15.700 --> 39:18.100
什么样的懦夫才做得出这般冷血行径
What kind of a coward would do something that cold-blooded ?

39:18.100 --> 39:20.480
躲在面具后的人
Someone who hides behind a mask.

39:20.500 --> 39:25.470
这种人嫉妒比自己幸运的人
Someone who is envious of those more fortunate than themselves,

39:26.140 --> 39:28.480
却不敢露出自己的真面目
yet they're too scared to show their own face.

39:29.090 --> 39:31.740
在这种人改过自新之前
And until all those kind of people change for the better..

39:32.150 --> 39:35.980
我们这些有所成就的人
those of us who've made something of our lives,

39:35.990 --> 39:37.860
将会一直把这些一事无成的人
will always look at those who haven't

39:38.420 --> 39:40.230
看作跳梁小丑
as nothing but clowns.

39:42.340 --> 39:44.940
托马斯·韦恩  感谢你接受采访
Thomas Wayne, thank you for coming in this morning.

39:44.940 --> 39:46.110
这不好笑
It's not funny.

40:07.580 --> 40:10.120
我那天在收音机里听到这首歌了
I heard this song on the radio the other day.

40:12.630 --> 40:14.170
那个家伙唱着
And the guy was singing,

40:14.780 --> 40:16.770
说他的名字叫嘉年华
that his name was Carnival.

40:17.750 --> 40:20.340
-亚瑟  -太疯狂了
- Arthur. - It's just crazy,

40:22.670 --> 40:25.180
因为这是我工作时的小丑昵称
because that's my clown name. At work.

40:26.780 --> 40:28.640
直到不久前
But until a while ago

40:30.390 --> 40:32.600
好像都没人注意到我
it was like nobody ever saw me.

40:34.980 --> 40:37.240
连我都不确定自己是否真的存在
Even I didn't know if I really existed.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.400
亚瑟  我有坏消息要告诉你
Arthur, I have some bad news for you.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.910
你根本没听  对吧
You don't listen, do you?

40:46.620 --> 40:48.390
我觉得你从来都没
I don't think you ever

40:49.110 --> 40:50.730
认真听我说话
really hear me.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.380
你只是每周重复同样的问题
You just ask the same questions every week:

40:54.620 --> 40:55.790
"工作顺利吗"
"How's your job?"

40:56.020 --> 40:58.200
"有没有消极的想法"
"Are you having any negative thoughts?"

40:59.000 --> 41:02.330
我脑袋里全是消极的想法
All I have are negative thoughts.

41:02.820 --> 41:05.340
反正你也听不进去
But you don't listen, anyway.

41:05.890 --> 41:06.960
我说了
I said,

41:07.380 --> 41:09.090
我这辈子
for my whole life

41:09.490 --> 41:12.610
都不确定自己是否真的存在
I didn't know if I even really existed.

41:13.980 --> 41:15.310
但现在我确定了
But I do.

41:16.990 --> 41:20.320
人们开始注意到我了
And people are starting to notice.

41:22.720 --> 41:23.860
他们砍了我们的预算
They've cut our funding.

41:24.620 --> 41:26.560
我们下周就要关闭了
We're closing down our offices next week.

41:27.990 --> 41:29.970
市政府在大幅度削减预算
The city's cut funding across the board,

41:29.970 --> 41:31.890
其中包括社会福利
social services is part of that.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.970
这是我们最后一次见面了
This is the last time we will be meeting.

41:35.120 --> 41:35.840
好吧
Okay.

41:40.450 --> 41:42.860
他们根本不在乎你这种人  亚瑟
They don't give a shit about people like you, Arthur.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.840
他们也不在乎我这种人
And they really don't give a shit about people like me, either.

41:51.500 --> 41:52.280
操
Oh, fuck.

42:00.960 --> 42:03.230
以后我该怎么拿药
How am I supposed to get my medication now?

42:06.600 --> 42:07.610
我该去找谁
Who do I talk to?

42:10.550 --> 42:12.090
抱歉  亚瑟
I'm sorry, Arthur.

42:14.770 --> 42:18.710
我想大多数女人把性事看作是买车
I think, uh-- I think most women look at sex like buying a car.

42:19.290 --> 42:21.680
就好比"这车我能长久开下去吗"
You know, like, "Can I see myself in this long term?"

42:22.150 --> 42:25.520
安全吗  可靠吗
Is it safe? Is it reliable?

42:25.710 --> 42:27.160
会害死我吗
Could it kill me?

42:28.250 --> 42:30.330
而大多数男人把性事看作是停车
Most guys look at sex like parking a car.

42:30.330 --> 42:31.870
比如"这儿有个车位"
We're like "There's a spot".

42:32.850 --> 42:34.860
"那边还有一个  那边也行"
"There is another spot, that would work."

42:35.330 --> 42:37.780
"还得花钱呢  那算了"
"Oh, I have to pay? Never mind."

42:39.530 --> 42:42.400
"残障人士专用  希望没人看到"
"Handicapped? Hope no one sees us."

42:45.140 --> 42:47.450
好了我讲完了  谢谢各位
Alright that's my time. Thank you very much, guys.

42:52.460 --> 42:54.300
大家再次为山姆·莫尔鼓掌
One more time, Sam Mohr, ya' all.

42:55.770 --> 42:57.420
下一位喜剧演员
Alright, this next comic

42:57.420 --> 43:00.010
说自己在哥谭市住了一辈子
describes himself as a lifelong Gotham resident

43:00.010 --> 43:02.520
从小就有人经常对他说
who from a young age was always told that:

43:02.520 --> 43:03.830
"他人生的意义就是
"His purpose in life was to

43:03.830 --> 43:07.660
为这个寒冷黑暗的世界带来笑声"
bring laughter and joy into this cold, dark world."

43:08.550 --> 43:09.410
好吧
Okay.

43:09.740 --> 43:13.480
请掌声欢迎亚瑟·弗莱克  亚瑟·弗莱克
Please help me welcome Arthur Fleck, ya'all. Arthur Fleck.

大家好  很高兴来到这里
Hello, it's good to be here---

43:51.830 --> 43:52.740
我讨厌
I hate--

44:03.960 --> 44:06.280
我小时候
I---I hated

44:06.280 --> 44:07.880
讨厌上学
school as a kid.

44:23.280 --> 44:27.130
我小时候讨厌上学
I hated school as a-- as a kid.

44:29.330 --> 44:30.830
但我母亲总是对我说
But my mother would always say,

44:31.140 --> 44:35.100
"你应该享受校园生活  你早晚要为生计奔波"
"You should enjoy it. One day you'll have to work for a living."

44:36.160 --> 44:39.620
"不会的  妈  我要当喜剧演员"
"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!"

44:51.870 --> 44:52.550
来个好笑的
Here is one.

44:54.450 --> 44:57.720
那天我正好在想
You know, I was just thinking the other day,

44:58.090 --> 45:01.050
有钱人为什么都...
why are the rich people so---

45:27.420 --> 45:29.680
杀手小丑逍遥法外
杀人凶手的最新消息

45:39.970 --> 45:41.300
你相信他们说的吗
Do you believe that shit?

45:42.060 --> 45:44.070
义警小丑?
九号列车发生暴力事件
据称三人因争执被杀

45:43.390 --> 45:44.090
去他们的
Fuck 'em!

45:46.300 --> 45:48.250
我认为这个人是个英雄
I think the guy that did it is a hero.

45:50.870 --> 45:54.670
哥谭市少了三个混蛋  还剩下一百万个
Three less pricks in Gotham city, only a million more to go.

46:24.870 --> 46:26.690
我知道你们会怎么想
I know what you're gonna be thinking.

46:26.790 --> 46:29.740
伙计  像往常一样  谢谢你带来的欢笑
And buddy, as always thanks for the laughs.

46:29.780 --> 46:33.290
我们当然会再见面  你会来对吧  希望你会来

46:45.350 --> 46:46.840
"这就是人生"
"That's Life".

46:51.150 --> 46:52.140
这就是人生
That's life.

46:57.190 --> 47:00.260
妈妈  醒醒  我们去床上睡
Mom, time to wake up. We go to bed.

47:03.920 --> 47:05.630
不  开心
No, Happy.

47:08.010 --> 47:09.980
我又给他写了封信
I wrote him a new letter.

47:10.130 --> 47:11.710
来吧  跟我跳舞
Come on, dance with me.

47:12.780 --> 47:15.360
给托马斯·韦恩  这很重要
For Thomas Wayne. That's important.

47:23.950 --> 47:25.410
你好像喷了古龙水
You smell like cologne.

47:26.130 --> 47:28.090
因为我刚刚去约会了
Because I just had a big date.

47:32.860 --> 47:34.940

亲爱的托马斯
我很可能命不久矣  因为我最近病得厉害
所以才给你写这封信
你非常明白  我很爱你
过去七个月  我怀抱微弱希望
给你寄了很多信  希望你能够回复
我真的不希望这么多年后还打扰你
我也知道当年我们的爱情给彼此带来了多少痛苦
我知道我可能会遭人嘲笑
但我需要你的帮助  我和你儿子都需要你的帮助
我承认我求你是因为我目前的状况...

48:30.650 --> 48:35.910
我和你儿子都需要你的帮助

48:42.610 --> 48:51.740
...非常悲惨  我没有保险
也没有任何未来的机会
托马斯  你是我和你儿子唯一的希望
亚瑟是个好孩子  虽然有点悲观  但是个好人
我想你会为他的工作感到自豪
我陪伴他的日子已经头了

48:54.370 --> 48:58.420
托马斯  我求你发发善心
至少给我们些钱  帮我们摆脱困境
成为那种你可以爱上和尊重的人
永远爱你  潘妮·弗莱克

49:08.180 --> 49:11.200
你会害死我的  你会害我心脏病发作
You're gonna kill me! You're gonna give me a heart attack!

49:11.200 --> 49:14.100
-别来这一套  -不  不
- Don't give me your-- - No! No!

49:14.600 --> 49:17.580
你不生气了我再跟你说话
I'm not talking to you until you stop being angry!

49:17.580 --> 49:18.540
好吧
Okay.

49:19.170 --> 49:19.880
行
Okay.

49:24.650 --> 49:25.980
我没生气  妈

49:27.050 --> 49:28.090
我没生气
I'm not angry.

49:29.470 --> 49:30.430
拜托

49:31.730 --> 49:34.700

他说为了顾及颜面  我们最好
He said it was best if we would not be together

49:50.450 --> 49:52.120
不要在一起
because of appearances.

49:54.910 --> 49:58.130
我不能告诉任何人  因为
And I couldn't tell anyone because,

49:59.190 --> 49:59.900
这个
well,

50:00.750 --> 50:02.310
我签了保密协议

而且你可以想象到人们会怎么说
And besides, you can imagine what people would say about

50:07.960 --> 50:09.820
我和托马斯
Thomas and me and...

50:11.750 --> 50:13.250
他们会怎么说你
what they'd say about you.

50:17.500 --> 50:19.200
他们会怎么说  妈
What would they say, mom?

告诉我什么
Told me what?

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.270
你母亲在为我们工作期间收养了你
Your mother adopted you while she was working for us.

01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:18.670
这不是真的  你为什么这么说
That's not true. Why are you saying that?

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:21.440
因为她在你还小的时候被捕
Because she was arrested and committed to Arkham State Hospital

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.970
并被关进阿卡姆州立医院
when you were just a little boy.

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:24.230
你为什么这么说
Why are you saying this?

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.670
我不需要你骗我  我知道这很奇怪
I don't need you to tell me lies. I know it seems strange.

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:29.340
我无意惹你不快
I don't mean to make you uncomfortable.

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.200
我不明白为什么大家都这么没礼貌
I don't know why everyone is so rude,

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.970
为什么你也是这样  我不想从你那得到什么
and I don't why you are, I don't want anything from you.

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:36.540
或许一点点温暖  或许一个拥抱  爸爸
Maybe a little bit of warmth, maybe a hug, dad!

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.600
连一点点尊重都不舍得吗
How much is a little bit of fucking decency?

01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:40.100
你们这些人是怎么回事
What is it with you people?!

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:41.970
你说那些话侮辱我母亲
You say that staff about my mother?

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:44.630
-她是个疯子  -她...
- She's crazy. - She's--

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.600
-你觉得这很好笑吗  -是的
- You think this is funny? - Yeah--

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.330
爸爸  是我
Dad, it's me!

01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.410
拜托
Come on--

01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:05.030
你再碰我儿子  我就杀了你
You touch my son again, I'll fucking kill you!

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:37.240
默里最近在节目中放了一段你的单口相声表演

01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:53.300
是啊  有些是
Yeah. Some have.

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:58.670
有些只是疯了  对他们自己或他人构成危险
You know. Some are just crazy and pose a danger to themselves or others.

01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:00.670
还有些人无处可去

想要一直开心真的是...
It's so hard just to try and be...

听着  伙计
Listen, man...

01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:43.300
我只是个行政助理

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.500
文职人员
Like a clerk, you know.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.200
我只负责整理文件
All I do is file paperwork,

01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:48.800
我不知道该和你说什么
I don't know what to tell you,

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:50.730
不过你应该去看看心理咨询师
but you should see somebody.

01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:54.570
政府有相关项目  市民服务之类的
They have programs, city services, stuff like that.

抱歉  伙计
I'm sorry, man.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.900
我说过  没有填表签字批准
Like I said, I can't release these records, you know,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.340
我不能给你这些记录
without the proper forms.

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.570
我会被连累的
I--I could get in trouble.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.840
如果你能把你母亲带来签字
Look, if you wanna bring your mom in here to sign,

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.670
手续会更好办
that would be much easier,

01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:01.730
但我不能不经签字批准就给文件  懂吗
but, I can't-- I can't let this go without a signature, okay?

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.130
抱歉
I'm sorry.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:08.530
不行  伙计

都是托马斯编的瞎话
Thomas had them all made up,

01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:26.670
好继续隐瞒这事
so it stayed our secret.

01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:29.400
没有
No.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.930
那你肯定是要去市政府参加集会
You must be going down to that rally at City Hall.

01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:35.000
我听说会很疯狂
I hear It's gonna be nuts.

01:26:46.210 --> 01:26:47.370
对  我们听说了
Right. We heard.

01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:49.430
所以我们才来的  觉得...
That's-- that's why we came by. Figured...

01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:51.430
你可能需要一点安慰
you could use some cheering up.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.170
真体贴
That's sweet.

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.260

警察来了店里好几次
the cops had been calling around the shop

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.720
问地铁谋杀案

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:17.870
相关的事情
those subway murders.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.990
他们没问我
They didn't talk to me.

01:27:21.630 --> 01:27:24.400
因为嫌犯是正常身材
That's because the suspect was a regular sized person.

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:27.390
如果嫌犯是个侏儒  你现在就该进监狱了
If it was a fucking midget you'd be in jail right now.

01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:34.050
不管怎样...

Thank you.

01:35:32.250 --> 01:35:33.690
你脸上的妆是怎么回事
What's with the face?

01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:35.170
你也是示威者中的一员吗
That mean that you are part of the protest?

01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:36.740
不
No.

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.070

01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.030
我什么都不信
I don't believe in anything.

01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:43.300
我只是觉得这妆会很适合我的表演
I just thought it would be good for my act.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.590
你的表演  你没听说地铁上的那桩惨案吗

-是吗  -你看  我告诉过你
- Yeah? - You see ,this is what I'm telling you.

01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:53.530
你要是让这家伙上台观众就要发疯了
the audience is gonna go crazy if you put this guy on.

01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:55.940
可能就让他上一小段  但别上整场
Maybe, maybe for a bit, but not a whole segment.

01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.660
吉恩  能行的  没事
Gene, It's gonna work. It's gonna work.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.280

We're gonna go with it.

谢谢你  默里
Thank you, Murray.

01:36:02.710 --> 01:36:04.030

Couple of rules, though:

01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:05.950
不能骂脏话  不能讲黄段子
No cursing, no off-color material,

01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:08.890
我们是个正经节目  行吗
we do a clean show, okay?

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.590
你在萨莉医生后面上场
You go on right after Dr. Sally.

好的
Okay.

01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:21.220
默里  有件小事
Hey, Murray...one small thing.

01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:23.780
-什么  -介绍我出场的时候
- Yeah? - When you bring me out

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:26.330
你能叫我"小丑"吗
can you introduce me as "Joker"?

01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:27.860
你为什么不用真名
What's wrong with your real name?

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.860
你之前在节目上就是这么叫我的
That's what you called me on the show.

01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:32.170
一个小丑
A Joker.

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:33.460
你还记得吗
Do you remember?

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.700
-是吗  -我不知道
- Did I? - Yeah, I don't know.

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:38.240
听你的  孩子  你就是小丑了
Well, if you say so, kid, you know, joker it is.

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.690
-这名字挺好的  -谢了  默里
- It's good. - Thanks, Murray.

01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:48.070
挂上笑脸

01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:03.420
我愿意试试
I would try it, you know,

01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:05.790
但我不确定我老婆会同意我这么干
but I'm not sure my wife would let me do it.

01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.650
可能我下一个老婆会同意
Maybe my next wife.

01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.960
你们得见见我们的下一位来宾
You gotta see our next guest for yourself.

01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:16.300
我相信这个家伙需要看医生
I'm pretty sure this guy can use a doctor.

01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:19.040
他有性方面的问题吗
Does he have a sexual problem?

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:21.520
他看起来可不止有一个问题
He looks like he's got a lot of problems.

01:37:22.650 --> 01:37:25.290
好了  让我们再最后看一遍那段视频
Alright, Let's show that clip one last time.

01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:35.880
我小时候讨厌上学
I hated school as a kid.

01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:38.990
但我母亲总是对我说
But my mother would always say,

01:37:39.490 --> 01:37:41.130
"你应该享受校园生活
"You should enjoy it.

01:37:41.130 --> 01:37:43.790
你早晚要为生计奔波"
One day you'll have to work for a living."

01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:47.650
"不会的  妈  我要当喜剧演员"
"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!"

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:54.720
好了
Okay,

01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:00.820
你们可能看过下一位嘉宾的这段视频
you may have seen that clip of our next guest.

01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:03.410
在他出场前  我只想说
Now, before he comes out, I just want to say

01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:07.100
我们都对今夜本市发生的状况感到心痛
that we're all heartbroken about what's going on in the city tonight.

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:09.570
但这是他选择的出场方式
But, this is how he wanted to come out.

01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:12.910
而且说实话  我觉得我们都需要好好笑一场
And, honestly, I think we could all use a good laugh.

01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:15.480
那么  有请"小丑"登场
So, please welcome "Joker".

01:38:57.930 --> 01:38:59.540
你还好吗  医生
Are you alright, doctor?

01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:05.500
这个出场可真厉害
Well, that was... quite an entrance.

01:39:12.230 --> 01:39:13.240
你没事吧
You okay?

01:39:15.710 --> 01:39:16.580
我很好
Oh, yeah.

01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:20.400
这和我想象的一模一样
This is exactly how I imagined it.

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.760
我的想象可不是这样
Well, that makes one of us.

01:39:30.770 --> 01:39:33.290
你能和我们聊聊你这身打扮吗
So, can you tell us about this look?

01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:34.840
我们之前聊的时候  你说过
When we spoke earlier, you mentioned

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:37.740
你的装扮不是在表达政治观点  对吧
that this look is not a political statement, is that right?

01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:39.810
没错  默里  我不关心政治
That's right, Murray. I'm not political.

01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:42.160
我只是想让大家笑出来
I'm just trying to make people laugh.

01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:43.850
你觉得你干得怎么样
And how's that goin' for ya?

01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:54.340
没事  我知道你是个喜剧演员
It's alright. It's alright. So, I know you're a comedian.

01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:56.350
最近有什么新的段子吗
Have you been working on any new material?

01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:57.860
你想给大家讲个笑话吗
You want to tell us a joke?

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.070
想听吗
Yeah?

01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:07.260
好呀
Okay.

01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:14.710

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:17.730
笑话本子
A book of jokes.

默里·富兰克林现场秀

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:23.410
我只希望我的死亡比我的人生更有"价值"

01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:28.800
不着急  我们有一整晚的时间
Take your time. We got all night.

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:37.290
好  我找到一个
Okay. Okay. Here's one.

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.880
咚咚咚
Knock-knock.

01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:44.530
就这你也要翻本子找
And you had to look that up?

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.550
我想把这个笑话讲好
I wanted to get it right.

01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:56.240
咚咚咚
Knock-knock.

01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:57.870
谁啊
Who's there?

01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:00.970
是警察  女士
It's the police, ma'am.

01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:03.080
你儿子被酒驾司机撞了
Your son has been hit by a drunk driver.

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.290
他死了
He's dead.

01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:09.040
不不不
Oh, no, no, no!

01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:11.100
你不能拿这个开玩笑
No, you cannot joke about that.

01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:13.140
是啊  这不好笑  亚瑟
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.920
我们的节目不开这种玩笑
That's not the kind of humor we do on this show.

01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:18.600
好吧  我...我很抱歉
Okay, I'm s... Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.100
只不过
It's just, you know,

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:23.420
我这几周很不好过  默里
it's been a rough few weeks, Murray.

01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:26.250
自从我...
Ever since I

01:41:28.890 --> 01:41:31.490
杀了那几个华尔街精英之后
killed those three Wall Street guys.

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.650
好吧  我还在等笑点
Okay. I'm waiting for the punchline.

01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:42.610
没有笑点
There is no punchline.

01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:45.650
这不是开玩笑
It's not a joke.

01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:51.820
你认真的吗
You're serious, aren't you?

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:54.710
你是说地铁上那三个年轻人是你杀的
You're telling us you killed those three young men on the subway?

01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:57.470
我们为什么要信你
And why should we believe you?

01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:59.490
我现在一无所有
I've got nothing left to lose.

01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:03.260
没有什么能再伤害我了
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

01:42:06.630 --> 01:42:09.680
我的人生就是一场喜剧
My life is nothing but a comedy.

01:42:12.930 --> 01:42:13.780
让我理一理
Let me get this straight,

01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:16.710
你觉得杀了那些人很好笑吗
you think that killing those guys is funny?

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.270
没错
I do.

01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:21.470
而且我受够了假装不好笑
And I'm tired of pretending it's not.

01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:23.930
喜剧是很主观的  默里
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:25.330
大家不都这么说吗
Isn't that what they say?

01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:27.250
你们所有人
All of you,

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.510
你们的体制无作不知
the system that knows so much,

01:42:30.510 --> 01:42:33.480
你们决定是非对错
you decide what's right or wrong

01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:37.720
同样的  你们也决定什么好笑
the same way that you decide what's funny...

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:39.180
或不好笑
or not.

01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:41.350
把他赶下去
Get him off!

01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:45.510
好吧  我可能理解你了
Well, okay, I--I think I might understand that you

01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:47.320
你这样做是为了发起一场运动
did this to start a movement,

01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.790
成为一种象征
to become a symbol.

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.570
拜托  默里
Come on, Murray,

01:42:51.570 --> 01:42:54.260
我看起来像那种可以发起运动的小丑吗
do I look like the kind of a clown that could start a movement?

01:42:54.690 --> 01:42:57.400
我杀人  是因为他们是人渣
I killed those guys because they were awful.

01:42:57.830 --> 01:43:00.460
这年头人人都是人渣
Everybody's awful these days.

01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:02.700
足以逼疯任何人
It's enough to make anyone crazy.

01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:05.390
这么说你是疯子  这就是你
Okay. So that's it, you're crazy. That's your defense

01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:07.120
杀死三个年轻人的理由吗
for killing three young men?

01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:08.690
不是
Nah.

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:13.290
他们连首歌都唱不好  所以才会丧命
They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives.

01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:18.150
为什么大家都为他们难过
Why is everybody so upset about these guys?

01:43:18.690 --> 01:43:22.190
如果是我死在路边  你们连看都不会看
If it was me dying on the side-walk, you'd walk right over me.

01:43:22.190 --> 01:43:25.190
我每天从你们身边走过  没人注意我  但是他们
I pass you everyday and you don't notice me! But these guys,

01:43:25.190 --> 01:43:28.720
托马斯·韦恩在电视上哭诉几句  你们就关心了
what, because Thomas Wayne went and cried about them on TV?

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.720
你对托马斯·韦恩也有意见
Well, you have a problem with Thomas Wayne,too?

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:32.390
是的
Yes, I do.

01:43:33.090 --> 01:43:36.450
你见过外面的世界吗  默里
Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray?

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:39.150
你真的离开过演播室吗
Do you ever actually leave the studio?

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:43.650
每个人都对彼此大喊大叫
Everybody just yells and screams at each other.

01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:45.560
根本没人有礼貌
Nobody's civil anymore!

01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:49.220
根本没人设身处地为他人着想
Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy.

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.290
你认为托马斯·韦恩那种人
You think men like Thomas Wayne

01:43:52.290 --> 01:43:55.260
考虑过我这种人的感受吗
ever think what it's like to be someone like me?

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.190
考虑除了自己以外的人  不会的
To be somebody but themselves? They don't.

01:43:58.250 --> 01:44:01.250
他们认为我们会像听话的小孩一样
They think that we'll just sit there and take it

01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:03.090
忍气吞声  默默承受
like good little boys!

01:44:03.090 --> 01:44:05.590
我们不会翻脸发狂
That we won't werewolf and go wild.

01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:06.760
说完了吗
You finished?

01:44:07.090 --> 01:44:09.620
你也太自怜自哀了  亚瑟
I mean, there is so much self-pity, Arthur.

01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:12.920
听起来像是在为杀死那些年轻人找借口
You sound like you're making excuses for killing those young men.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:16.320
这话我可以告诉你  并不是人人都是人渣
Not everybody-- and I'll tell you this-- not everyone is awful.

01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:20.890
-但你是人渣  默里  -我吗
- But you're awful, Murray. - Me?

01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:23.620
我是人渣  是吗  怎么说
I'm awful? Oh, yeah? How am I awful?

01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:27.420
播放我的视频
Playing my video,

01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:30.520
邀请我上节目
inviting me on the show---

01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:34.490
你只是想取笑我
You just wanted to make fun of me.

01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:37.120
你跟他们没有区别
You're just like the rest of 'em.

01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:39.390
你根本不了解我  伙计
You don't know the first thing about me, pal.

01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:42.250
看看因为你的所作所为而导致的后果
Look what happened because of what you did, what it led to.

01:44:42.250 --> 01:44:43.950
全城都暴动了
There are riots out there.

01:44:43.950 --> 01:44:46.690
两名警察命悬一线  而你却在笑
Two policemen are in critical condition and you're laughing.

01:44:46.690 --> 01:44:49.220
你还在笑  因为你的所作所为
You're laughing. Someone was killed today

01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:50.790
今天有人被杀了
because of what you did.

01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:51.820
我知道
I know.

01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:56.250
再来个笑话怎么样  默里
How about a another joke, Murray?

01:44:56.250 --> 01:44:58.120
不  我们已经听够你的笑话了
No, I think we got enough of your jokes.

01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.550
-如果你  -别讲了
- What do you get... - I don't think so.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:03.450
惹恼了一个被社会鄙视抛弃的

Call the police, Gene.

01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:08.290
-我告诉你会发生什么  -报警

01:45:08.290 --> 01:45:10.420
你会自食其果
You get what you fucking deserve!

? 这就是人生 ?
? That's life ?

01:54:59.950 --> 01:55:04.220
? 这就是人生  我得承认 ?
? That's life and I tell ya, I can't deny it ?

01:55:04.650 --> 01:55:07.650
? 我数次想要放弃 ?
? Many times I thought of cuttin' out?

01:55:07.650 --> 01:55:10.060

? but my heart won't buy it ?

01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:15.320
? 但如果等到七月还没有转机 ?
? But if there's nothing shakin' come here this July ?

01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:20.820
? 我就要蜷缩起来 ?
? I'm gonna roll myself up ?

01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:29.190
? 然后去死 ?
? in a big ball and die ?

01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:38.690
? 哎呀呀 ?
? My, my ?

01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:38.560
