说实话  这酒好喝得让你醉生梦死
Honestly, this whisky is amazing. You will shit.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.590
找你借杯糖算过分吗
I suppose asking to borrow a cup of sugar is a step too far?

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.060
阿诺德教授  我是来接您回家的
Professor Arnold. I'm here to take you home.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.240
62年的达尔摩
1962' Dalmore.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.680
洒一滴都是罪过  您说是吗
It'll be a sin to spill any, don't you think?

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.650
帮忙拿一下好吗
Can you hold these, please?

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.150

血腥暴力让我倒胃口  是真的倒胃口

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.160
见着一滴血  我就玩完
I see one drop of blood, that is me done.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.720
条件反射地开始吐
I'm like...projectile.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.390
让您目睹如此不愉快的场面
Listen, I'm so sorry you have to witness

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.470
我深表歉意
all this unpleasantness,

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.860
都怪那位不速之客
due to our uninvited guest.

不过我保证  不用等我查清他的底细

大家都开始怀疑
The others are beginning to wonder

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.920
是不是要敬两次酒了
if we're going to have a double toast.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.760
先生们  上一次进行这项仪式
Gentlemen. I'm thankful to say it's been 17 years

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.020
已经是17年前了  我觉得很欣慰
since we last had the occasion to use this decanter.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.800
兰斯洛特是位杰出的特工
Lancelot was an outstanding agent

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.220

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.830
我们将永远缅怀他
He'll be sorely missed.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.660
-敬兰斯洛特  -敬兰斯洛特
- To Lancelot. - To Lancelot.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.250
我提议  明天就启动
I intend to start selection

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.670

梅林  进来吧
Merlin. Come in.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.060
兰斯洛特当时正在调查
Lancelot was investigating a group of mercenaries

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.800
一个进行生化武器试验的佣兵团伙
who were experimenting with biological weaponry.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.250
请戴眼镜  先生们
Glasses, gentlemen, please.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.730
乌干达  2012年  合成卡西酮
Uganda, 2012. Synthetic cathinones.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.660
投入了游击队基地的水源
They put it in the water supply of a guerilla army base.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.640
狂乱  食人  致死无数
Rage, cannibalism, multiple fatalities.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.590
车臣  2013年  起义军发生内乱
Chechnya, 2013. Insurgents turned on one another.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.200
显然是这群佣兵所为
Indisputably the work of our mercenaries

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.600
但未发现任何化学物质的痕迹
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.080
兰斯洛特是怎么回事
So what happened to Lancelot?

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.860
他追查到了该团伙在阿根廷的一处房产
He tracked them to this property in Argentina.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.170
监视过程中
While he had them under survelillance

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.580
他发现他们绑架了一名人质
he became awared that they'd effected a kidnapping.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.040
便进行单人营救  但是失败了
So he excuted a solo rescue mission which failed.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.910
被绑架人质为詹姆斯·阿诺德教授

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.560
这是他发送的最后一条信息
This is his last transmission.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.890
-这人是谁  -一个气候变化末日论者
- Who is he? - Some climate change doom-sayer

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.610
正在研究所谓的盖亚理论
experimenting on something called Gaia theory

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.480
说地球能自我修复什么的
about the world healing itself or some such.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.240
奇怪的是  他并没有失踪
But what's curious is he's not actually missing.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.510
这位就是阿诺德教授
This is Professor Arnold,

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.580
今早在帝国理工现身了
at Imperial College this morning.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.990
交给你了
It's all yours.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.030
别忘了找候选人的事
And don't forget your membership proposal.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.280
这次记得找个像样点的
Try picking a more suitable candidate this time.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.830
17年过去了
17 years

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.240
你还是不明白
and still evolving with the time

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.010
与时俱进是什么意思
remains an entirely foreign concept to you.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.230
别忘了  多亏了那位年轻人
Need I remind you I wouldn't be here

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.610
我才能坐在这里
if it weren't for that young man?

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.710
他不比其他候选人差多少
He was as much Kingsman material as any of them.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.980
甚至更优秀
More so.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.480
但他和我们并不是一类人
But he wasn't exactly one of us, was he?

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.350
别嘴硬了  加拉哈德  你的小实验失败了
Let's face it Galahad, your little experiment failed.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.390
并非冒犯  亚瑟  你太高高在上了
With respect, Arthur. You're a snob.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.520
这不是冒犯吗
With respect?

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.160
世界正在改变
The world is changing.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.850
贵族们的天赋越来越差是有原因的
There's a reason why aristocrats developed weak chins.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.620
艾格西
Eggsy?

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.390
艾格西  快过来
Eggsy, come here.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.610
-有烟纸吗  亲爱的  -没有
- Got any Rizla babe? - No.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.710
帮你老妈一个忙
Why don't you do your mama a favour

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.810
下楼买点回来
and go down the shop and get some?

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:18.590
自己买去
Get them yourself.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.650
我跟你说过  别用这种口气和迪恩讲话
What have I said to you about speaking to Dean like that?

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.200
三个人多挤  让迪恩的哈巴狗去
Three's a crowd, isn't it? Why don't Dean's Poodle go?

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.830
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.330
你拿着钱  去买点烟纸
Why don't you take this and go get some Rizlas,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.600
再给自己买点糖
get yourself some sweets.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.950
你走了之后
And while you're gone,

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.860
我让你妈体会体会三个人挤不挤
we'll show your mother how three can be a good company.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.880
谢谢  亲爱的
Thanks, babe.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:41.800
过来
Come here.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:47.820
给你
There we go.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.520
开心吧
Is that better?

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.850
迪恩对你老妈这么差  为什么不分手
If Dean treats your mum so bad, why don't she leave him?

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.900
缺乏自尊  这就是问题所在
Low self-esteem, that's her problem.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.810
瞎扯  她怎么可能没自尊呢
Fuck off. Why would she have low self-esteem, mate?

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.380
看他老妈那身材
Eggsy's mom is well fit.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.940
-天哪  -没别的意思  哥们
- Jesus. - No offence, pal.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:15.830
没关系
That's all right.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.590
总有一天  我要打烂他的脸
One of these days I'm gonna smash his face in.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.300
你脑子坏了吗
Are you mental, cuz?

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.920
他会让那帮家伙扁你一顿
He just get that lot to do you,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.540
然后假装自己什么都...
and then pretend he knew nothing...

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:26.980
不知道
...about it.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.080
你们以为我们老大在泡艾格西的老妈
Oi, you think you can chat shit about us and we won't do nothing,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.660
你们就可以嘴里喷粪了吗
just 'cause our governor's banging Eggsy's mum?

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.580
是啊  没错
Pretty much, yeah.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.870
惹他干嘛  赶紧走  不值得的
Well, just leave it. Let's just go, man. It's not worth it.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.750
这里不欢迎你们了
Your boys have outstayed your welcome.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.780
滚吧
Leave.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.320
干嘛
What?

You jacked his fucking car keys, bruv?

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.450
是啊  还要顺他的车呢
Yeah. Now we're gonna nick his car.

艾格西他妈的偷了我的车
Eggsy just stole my fucking car, yeah.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:46.850
我刚从酒吧出来
Yeah. I've come out of the pub

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.140
他当着我的面  原地转了有15圈
and he's done about 15 donuts in my fucking face

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.330
然后开走了
and he's drove off.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.070
我弄不回来  他藐视我
No, I can't have it. Look, he disrespecting me,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.080
等于是藐视你
and that means he's disrespecting you...

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.070
等等  搞什么
Hold, hold, hold up, what the...?

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.220
操
Dick!

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.440
狐狸就是畜生啊  你应该直接开过去
Foxes are vermin, cuz. Should've driven it over.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.190
我应该干的事多了去了
I should've done a lot of things.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.370
我来搞定  快下车
I'll sort this. Get outta the car.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.960
快他妈下车啊
I said, get out of the fucking car!

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.410
艾格西  做了贼就别想着荣誉感了
Eggsy, there is no such thing as honour amongst thieves.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.060
你要么乖乖
Now you can start giving me some names

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.900
供出小伙伴的名字
of the boys you were with,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.010
要么一个人坐牢
or you go down.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.640
自己选吧
It's up to you.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.190
我要打个电话  我有这个权利
I want to exercise my right to a phone call.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.310
最好是打给你老妈
Well, I hope it's to your mum.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.140
告诉她  你要18个月后才能回家吃晚饭
To tell her you're gonna be 18 months late for your dinner.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.750
客户投诉中心  请问有什么能帮您

我遇上麻烦了  现在人在霍尔本警察局

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.780
抱歉  先生  您打错了
Sorry, sir. Wrong number.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.260
等等
Wait, wait.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.870
牛津鞋  不雕花

好的  我完全理解
Yes, I totally understand.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.700
艾格西
Eggsy.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.600
要搭车回家吗
Would you like a lift home?

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.750
-你是谁  -把你弄出来的人
- Who are you? - The man who got you released.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.000
这不算回答
That ain't an answer.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.390
说声谢谢很难吗
A little gratitude would be nice.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.370
我叫哈利·哈特
My name is Harry Hart,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.740
那枚勋章是我给你的
and I gave you that medal.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.490
你父亲救过我一命
Your father saved my life.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.410
这么说  当裁缝之前你当过兵
So before you was a tailor you was in the army?

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.290
-是军官吗  -并不算
- Like an officer? - Not quite.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.790
你在哪儿服役  伊拉克之类的吗
So where were you posted, Iraq or something?

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.780
抱歉  艾格西  这是机密
Sorry, Eggsy, classified.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.900
但我老爸救过你的命  对吧
But my dad saved your life, eh?

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.020
你父亲牺牲的那天  是我的疏漏
The day your father died, I missed something.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.410
要不是他挺身而出
And if it weren't for his courage,

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.240
我的疏漏会让所有在场的人丧命
my mistake would have cost the lives of every man present.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.660
所以我欠他的
So I owe him.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.470
你父亲很勇敢  是个好人
Your father was a brave man, a good man.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.540
我读过你的档案
And having read your files,

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.040
你的某些选择会让他很失望吧
I think he'd be bitterly disappointed in the choices you've made.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.460
你没资格对我评头论足
You can't talk to me like that.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.240
智商超群  小学时期表现优异
Huge IQ, great performance at primary school.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.800
之后却越走越歪
And then it all went tits up.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.520
毒品  小偷小摸  从未有过像样的工作
Drugs, petty crime, never had a job.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.490
你以为现在工作很好找吗
Well, you think there's a lot of job going around here, do you?

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.280
那也不能说明你为什么放弃了爱好
Doesn't explain why you gave up your hobbies.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.350
连续两年获得地区10岁以下组体操冠军
First prize, regional under 10 gymnastics, two years in a row.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.640
你的教练本想培养你去奥运会
Your coach had you picked as Olympic team material.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.590
要是碰上像我继父那样的人
Yeah, well, when you grow up around someone like my stepdad,

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.960
很快就会沾染上别的爱好
you pick up new hobbies pretty quickly.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.380
当然  总是别人的错
Of course. Always someone else's fault.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.560
那你从海军陆战队退出又怪谁呢
Who's to blame for you quitting the marines?

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.460
训练已经过半
You're halfway through training,

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.960
表现优异  你却放弃了
doing brilliantly but you gave up.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.740
因为我妈妈快要疯了
Because my mum went mental.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.720
天天说会像失去老爸一样失去我
Banging on about losing me as well as my dad,

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.670
不想让我给你们这群老爷当炮灰
didn't want me being cannon fodder for snobs like you,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.120
高高在上  对我们指手画脚
judging people like me from your ivory towers,

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.550
却不想想我们的苦衷
with no thought about why we do what we do.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.360
我们也没得选  懂吗
We ain't got much choice, you get me?

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.560
如果能有好命  屁股插着金汤勺出生
And if we was born with the same silver spoons up our arses,

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.110
我们绝不比你们差
we'd do just as well as you,

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.650
只会更优秀
if not better.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.000
你他妈在这干什么  想找事吗
What the fuck you doing here? You taking a piss?

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.310
活生生的例子来了
Some more examples of young men

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.340
我看他们也只需要插个金汤勺
who simply need a silver suppository.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.110
不  他们是例外  走吧
No, they are exceptions, come on.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.590
胡扯  酒还没喝完呢
Nonsense. We haven't finished our drinks.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.160
因为你偷了他的车  迪恩说不用再留情
After you nicked his car, Dean says you're fair guy,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.870
他也不会再听你老妈的求情了
and he ain't give a shit what your mum says.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.610
小伙子们
Listen, boys.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.880
我今天情绪波动很大
I've had a rather emotional day,

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.880
不管你们和艾格西有什么过节
so whatever your beef with Eggsy is,

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.860
这孩子大概是有错在先
and I'm sure it's well founded,

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.000
我只希望你们能让我们单独待会
I'd appreciate it enormously if you could just leave us in peace,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.320
让我喝完这杯吉尼斯  谢谢
until I finish this lovely pint of Guinness.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:33.050
你最好闪远点  老爷爷  拳头不认人
You should get out of way, granddaddy, you'll get hurt and all.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.590
他不是开玩笑的  你走吧
He ain't joking, you should go.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:41.930
借过
Excuse me.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.360
再想找小鲜肉玩
You looking for another rent boy,

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.280

你们知道这句话的意思吗
Do you know what that means?

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.720
那我来教教你们吧
Then let me teach you a lesson.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.040
你们是想傻站一天
Are we gonna stand around here all day,

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.450
还是想打一架
or are we going to fight?

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.150
你个王八蛋  你他妈...
You fucking bastard, you fucking dirty...

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:16.770
击昏

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:17.020
击昏

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.490
失忆

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.200
抱歉
Sorry about that.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.510
我需要发泄一下
Needed to let off a little steam.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.480
一个朋友昨天死了

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.250
他也认识你父亲

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.770
我很抱歉  艾格西
Now, I do apologize, Eggsy.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.050
我不该在你面前做这些
I shouldn't have done this in front of you.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.380
不  求你了  我发誓一个字也不说
No, please. I won't say nothing, I swear.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.030
我最擅长保守秘密了
If there's one thing I can do, it's keep my mouth shut.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:16.980
谁也不说吗
You won't tell a soul?

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.740
你可以问条子  我从没出卖过人
Ask the feds. I've never grassed anyone out.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.570
-你发誓  -用生命担保
- Is that a promise? - On my life.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.800
非常感谢  艾格西
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.960
你说得对  老爷们是高高在上
You're right about the snobs.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.040
但他们中也有例外
But there too, there are exceptions.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.890

所以你最好放开小伙子
So I suggest you leave the boy alone

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.950
不然我将不得不
or I shall be forced to

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.290
把你的所作所为报告给相关部门
deliver it to the appropriate authorities.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.140
艾格西  去我跟你说的那个定制店找我
Eggsy, meet me at the tailor I told you about.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.560
这他妈怎么回事
What the fuck's going on here?

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.060
艾格西  你个混蛋
Eggsy, you fucking maggot!

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.990
站住  站住  你个...
Hi, come here! Come here, you fucking...

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.170
王八蛋  我早晚抓住你
You wanker! I'll have you, son!

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.560
王牌定制

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.740
虽然我没见过裁缝
I've never met a tailor before,

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.110
但你肯定不是裁缝
but I know you ain't one.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:10.880
跟我来
Come with me.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.180
进来
Come on in.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.740
你看见了什么
What do you see?

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.510
完全不知道这是怎么回事的人
Someone who wants to know what the fuck is going on.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.750
我觉得是个充满潜力的小伙子
I see a young man with potential.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.740
忠诚的人
A young man who is loyal,

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.610
能够信守承诺
who can do as he's asked,

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.330
这辈子想做点好事
and who wants to do something good with his life.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.110
你看过《颠倒乾坤》吗
Have you seen the film "Trading Places"?

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.070
没有
No.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.080
那《尼基塔》呢
How about "Nikita"?

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.450
《风月俏佳人》呢
"Pretty Woman"?

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:56.580
好吧
All right.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.160
我想说的是
My point is, the lack of

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.120
出身不好是限制了你的发展
a silver spoon had set you on a certain path

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.660
但你可以主动改变
but you needn't stay on it.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:07.020
准备好去适应  去学习  你会有成就的
If you're prepared to adapt and learn, you can transform.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.170
就像《窈窕淑女》那样
Like in "My Fair Lady"?

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.230
你还总是能给人惊喜
Well, you're full of surprises.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.290
对  就像《窈窕淑女》那样
Yes, like "My Fair Lady".

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.270
现在呢
And in this case

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.920
我给你一个加入我们的机会
I'm offering you the opportunity to become a Kingsman.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.610
做裁缝吗
A tailor?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.910
王牌特工
A Kingsman agent.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:26.550
间谍吗
Like a spy?

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.770
类似
Of sorts.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.830
有兴趣吗
Interested?

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.150
我还有什么可顾忌的吗
You think I've got anything to lose?

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.230
自1849年起
Since 1849,

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.580
王牌定制为全世界最有权势的人定制服装
Kingsman tailors clothed the world's most powerful individuals.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.590
到1919年
By 1919,

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.700
他们中的许多人在一战中失去了子嗣
a great number of them had lost their heirs to World War I.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.850
导致大量财富无人继承
That meant a lot of money going uninherited,

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.650
许多有权势的人
and a lot of powerful men

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.760
想站出来维护和平  拯救生命
with the desire to preserve peace and protect life.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.970
我们的创建者意识到
Our founders realized

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.970
他们可以用财富和影响力造福世人
that they can channel that wealth and influence for greater good.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.770
于是我们开始了另一项事业
And so began our other vention.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.160
一个独立的  国际性的情报机构
An independent international intelligence agency

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.340
全部行动保持最机密状态
operating at the highest level of discretion.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.920
不受政治和官僚的约束
Above the politics and bureaucracy

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.820
不然就成了政府的情报部门  毫无节操
that undermine the integrity of government ran spy organisations.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.020
西装是现代绅士的盔甲
A suit is a modern gentleman's armour.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.960
而王牌特工就是当代的骑士
And the Kingsman agents are the new knights.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.090
-这破玩意儿究竟有多深  -很深
- How deep does this fucking thing go? - Deep enough.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:18.020
该死  我们迟到了
Shit. We're late.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.470
你父亲当年也是这个表情
Your father had the same look on his face.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.330
我也是
As did I.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:50.880
过来吧
Come on.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.610
-加拉哈德  -这是我的代号
- Galahad. - My codename.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:57.920
又迟到了  长官
Late again, sir.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.130
-祝你好运  -进去吧
- Good luck. - In you go.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:13.800
集合
Fall in.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.410
女士们先生们  我的名字是梅林
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Merlin.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.580
你们马上要参加
You are about to embark on

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.090
很有可能是世界上最危险的面试
what's probably the most dangerous job interview in the world.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:29.090
有且只有一人能成为下一任兰斯洛特
One of you, and only one of you will become the next Lancelot.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.390
谁能告诉我这是什么
Can anybody tell me what this is?

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.670
-你来说  -收尸袋  长官
- Yes? - Bodybag, sir.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:36.750
正确
Correct.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.320
查理  对吧
Charlie, isn't it?

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.790
-是的  长官  -很好
- Yes, sir. - Good.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.430
过一会儿  你们每人都过来拿一个
In a moment, you'll each collect a bodybag.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.860
你们要写上自己的名字
You will write your name on that bag,

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:48.260
以及你们最近亲属的详细信息
you will write the details of your next of kin on that bag.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.900
这表示你们愿意承担接下来的风险
This represents your acknowledgement of the risks that you're about to face

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.870
也同意遵守严格的保密协议
as well as your agreement to strict confidentiality,

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.170
你们要是有人泄密
which, incidentally, if you break,

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.860
就会跟那位亲属一起
will result in you and your next of kin

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.740
进袋子里
being in that bag.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.750
明白了吗
Is that understood?

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.370
很好
Excellent.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.190
解散
Fall out.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.500
我是罗克茜安  叫我罗克茜就行
Roxanne, but call me Roxy.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.490
-我是艾格西  -蛋蛋

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.530
-不  艾格西  -蛋蛋
- No. Eggsy. - Eggy.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.480
他们从哪把你挖出来的
Where did they dig you up?

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.830
你该知道不能讨论推荐人的吧
You know we're not allowed to discuss who proposed us.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.250
别这么激动
No need to bite his head off.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.430
查理只是想随便聊聊  对吧  查理
Charlie's only making conversation, right, Charlie?

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:34.070
我是迪格比

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.880
-迪格比  -蛋蛋  这是鲁夫斯

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.110
鲁夫斯  蛋蛋

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.840
-你是牛津的还是剑桥的  -都不是

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:49.470
等等  我们是不是见过
Oh, wait, I think we may have met.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.200
在温彻斯特服务站的麦当劳  是你帮我点的餐吗
Did you serve me at the McDonald's in Winchester service station?

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.400
没有
No.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:55.670
要真是我  我一定给你
But if I had, I'd give you an extra

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.120
撸点秘制酱料
and open the secret sauce.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:58.980
绝对是圣安德鲁斯的
He's definitely St. Andrews.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:01.860
别理他们
Just ignore them.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.580
-你要笔吗  -谢谢
- You need a pen? - Cheers.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.220
阿米莉亚  对吗
Amelia, isn't it?

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.820
阿米莉亚  艾格西
Amelia, Eggsy.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.750
你好  艾格西
Hi, Eggsy.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.720
别理那些家伙
Don't take any notice of those guys.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.360
我也是这么说的
That's what I told him.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.700
姓名
血型
最近亲属

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.140
唬人的把戏  军队惯用伎俩
It's just scare tactics. Classic army technique.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.350
不会有人死的
No one's gonna die.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:22.140
真可惜
Shame.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.050
真棒  你不知道  中情局也不知道
Great. You don't know, the CIA don't know.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:28.750
没人知道这家伙是谁吗
Nobody knows who this guy is?

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:29.940
没事
Fine.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:31.970
说真的  没事
Seriously, that's fine.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:35.800
当然不是真的没事  但我不是为这个来的
Well, it's not really fine, but it's not why I'm here.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.620
哥们  你了解我的  我不在乎钱
Hell, man. You know me. Money's not my issue.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.450
我离开麻省理工的时候就可以退休
I could've retire straight out of MIT,

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.170
找个岛逍遥自在  让生意自己运转
fuck off to some island, let the business run itself.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:48.820
没人要我拯救地球  是我自己想
Nobody told me to try and save the planet, I wanted to.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.870
研究气候变化  游说政客
Climate change research, lobbying,

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.770
钻研多年  不断砸钱...
years of study, billions of dollars...

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.260
但你知道我为什么退出吗
and you know why I quit?

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.310
因为我没看错的话
Because the last time I checked,

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.770
地球依然是一塌糊涂
the planet was still fucked.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.370
因此我顿悟了
Hence, my epiphany.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.870
钱解决不了问题
Money won't solve this.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.440
那些自称为政客的蠢货们
Those idiots who call themselves politicians

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.120
只会把头埋进沙子
had buried their heads in the sand

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.300
毫无作为  只在乎连任
and stood for nothing but reelection.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.740
所以我花了两年  寻找真正的解决方法
So I spent the last two years trying to find the real solution.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.170
我找到了
And I found it.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:24.570
如果你想知道如何让世界更美好
Now, if you really wanna make the world a better place,

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.950
那最好洗耳恭听
I suggest you open your fucking ears,

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.700
因为我现在就要告诉你
because I'm about to tell it to you.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.560
说吧  瓦伦丁先生  我洗耳恭听
Go on, Mr. Valentine. I'm still listening.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.300
只要你同意我提出的所有条款
As long as you agree to all my terms.

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.720
别紧张  听我说  保持冷静
No one panic. Listen to me. Stay calm.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.030
该死
Fuck.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.050
用马桶通气  马桶通气
Loo snorkels, loo snorkels.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.360
-什么玩意  -用淋浴喷头
- Loo snorkels? - Shower heads!

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.010
-淋浴喷头  -她说的对  快  快
- Shower heads? - She's right. Go, fucking go!

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:43.840
等等  为什么不直接开门
Hang about, what's wrong with the fucking door?

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:10.770
恭喜你们完成了第一个任务
Congratulations on completing your first task.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.320
查理  罗克茜  好样的
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.600
顺便提醒一下仍然一头雾水的人
For those of you who are still confused,

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.880
拿根软管穿过马桶的U型弯
if you can get a breathing tube around the U-bend of a toilet,

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:19.900
就能呼吸到无限的空气
you have an unlimited air supply.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.440
简单的物理学知识  值得铭记
Simple physics, worth remembering.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.900
艾格西  恭喜你发现了这是双面镜
Eggsy, well done for spotting that was a two-way mirror.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.070
可能因为他见的太多了
He's probably seen enough of them.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.220
好了  没什么可笑的
Yeah, you can all wipe those smirks off your faces.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.610
因为在我这里
Because as far as I'm concerned,

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.460
你们全都不及格
every single one of you has failed.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.630
你们全都忘记了最重要的事情
You all forgot the most important thing.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:39.570
团队合作
Teamwork.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.340
看来是玩真的啊
So much for classic army technique.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:05.740
35  105  没错  就是这样
35, 105. That's it. That's it.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:11.590
你好
Hello.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.340
需要帮忙吗
Can I help you?

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:17.190
是的  我想咨询一下人类对地球的影响
Yes, I have a question about anthropogenic force.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.670
真的吗  这事可有意思了
Really? Well, it's actually quite fascinating.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.860
我的同事为了救你牺牲了
My colleague died trying to rescue you,

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.610
我相信你也看到了他有多厉害
and I'm sure you saw how well-trained he was,

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.330
所以你最好告诉我是谁绑架了你
so I suggest you tell me who kidnapped you

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:29.620
为什么又放你走
and why they let you go?

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.750
我不知道...
I have no idea what...

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.230
我不能说  他说这是...
I'm not supposed to say, he said it was...

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.580
我的老天  我都没使劲儿
Oh, for God's sake, I barely touched you.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.610
你怎么这么...
Oh, man up...

00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:00.510
植入设备已激活

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.020
这个王八蛋  不管他是谁  我都...
Fuck that guy, whoever he is, I'm gonna...

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.360
竟然逼我杀了阿诺德教授
Made me kill Professor Arnold.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.910
我他妈爱死阿诺德教授了
I goddamn love Professor Arnold.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:06.840
好消息是
Well, the good news is,

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.010
我们知道了应急和监控系统运行良好
we know the emergency and surveillance system works.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.840
你知道什么不是好消息吗
You know what's not good news?

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.600
"我的同事牺牲了"  他这么说的
"My colleague died", that's what he said.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.230
这是个组织  他们现在盯上咱们了
This is an organisation and they're all over us.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.110
-你跟哪些机构联系了  -我说了
- Whoever you spoke to...- I told you,

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.110
我联系了克格勃  军情六处
I made contact with the KGB, MI6,

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:23.020
摩萨德和北京
Mossad and Beijing.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.640
都坚称不是他们的人
They all insist he wasn't one of theirs.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.910
北京
Beijing.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.790
中国的秘密情报局连个特别点的名字都没有
So freaky how there's no recognizable name

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:30.540
想想就害怕
for the Chinese Secret Service.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.500
不过那才叫秘密  对吧
Now that's what you call a secret, right?

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.500
这样  让他们去死吧
You know what? Fuck it.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.250
我们必须加快速度
We need to speed things up.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:39.670
提前发布产品
Bring the product release forward.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:41.720
可还没完成大规模生产
We're only halfway into production,

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.420
加速是要多花钱的
and speeding it will cost a fortune.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.170
你觉得我在乎吗  照我说的做
Do I look like I give a fuck? Just get it done!

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.880
你们昨晚应该已经意识到了
As some of you would have learnt last night,

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.300
对于王牌特工来说  团队合作至关重要
teamwork is paramount here at a Kingsman.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.610
为了强化你们的技能  测试你们的极限
We're here to enhance your skills, test you to your limits,

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.040
你们必须每人选只小狗
which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.330
你们去哪儿  狗就去哪儿
Wherever you go, your dog goes.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.550
你们要照顾它  训练它
You will care for it, you will teach it.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.600
把它们训练好  你们也就快了
And by the time it's fully trained, so will you be.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.050
当然得保证不被淘汰
Those of you who're still here, that is.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:15.770
明白了吗
Do you understand?

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.840
挑一只吧
Choose your puppy.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:22.350
贵宾犬
A poodle?

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.390
怎么了  他们是猎犬
What? They're gundogs.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.270
最古老的犬类了  容易训练
Oldest barking breed, easy to train.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.910
哈巴狗
A pug?

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:33.810
这是斗牛犬吧
It's a bulldog, ain't it?

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.220
但它会长大的对不对
It'll get bigger, though, won't it?

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.560
该死的
Shit.

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.040
从磁共振成像来看  没有脑震荡的迹象
His MRI shows no signs of concussion.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.170
头部也无明显外伤
No direct brain trauma at all.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.800
要多久才能下床活动
How much longer can he be out?

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.520
这个问得好
That's the million dollar question.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.460
我们不清楚他到底沾上了什么东西
We don't know what he was exposed to in there.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.960
那哈利的录像呢
What about Harry's footage,

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.790
没有传送回终端吗
it didn't stream to his home terminal?

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:04.280
严格加密且无法破解
Encrypted and uncrackable.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.130
所以等他醒了以后
If and when he comes around,

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.080
你最好请他分享一下密码
you might wanna have a word with him about sharing his password.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.440
他会好起来的吧
Is he gonna be all right?

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.120
要耐心点  艾格西
We need to have patience, Eggsy.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.960
但希望还是有的
But there's hope, okay?

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.930
我是你的话就会全心投入训练
If I were you, I'll concentrate on your training,

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:20.360
顺利通过所有测试  让他为你自豪
make it through the test, make him proud.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:29.270
走啊  走啊
Come on, come on!

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.040
JB  动起来  动起来
JB, come on, come on!

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.280
我可不想因为你而垫底
I'm not coming last 'cause of you.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:40.390
JB  再不走信不信我他妈毙了你
JB, I'll shoot you, got me? I'll fucking shoot you.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.070
梅林不允许我抱着你走
Merlin said we're not allowed to hold you.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.920
管他呢
Bollocks.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.020
又进水了
Water!

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.610
-想打架  -算了  艾格西
- Come on, eh? - Eggsy, forget it!

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:36.330
怎么了  这么开不起玩笑
Oh, what's wrong, mate? You can't take a joke?

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.710
打架会被淘汰的  你这么做不值当
Seriously, you'll get thrown out and it's just not worth it.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.380
我他妈才不在乎淘不淘汰
Maybe I don't give a fuck about get kicked out!

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.940
那动手啊  你个下等人
Do it. Come on, you pleb.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.140
查理  滚一边去
Charlie, fuck off!

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.060
滚开  少来惹我
Yeah, go on. Walk away.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:48.980
神经病
Dickhead.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.090
没事了  JB
Come on JB.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:52.520
乖狗狗
Good boy.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.510
你们有一小时完成测试
You have exactly one hour to complete the test,

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:09.580
计时开始
starting now.

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:13.970
前方八百米  发现新目标
New target, 800 metres.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:15.880
真不敢相信你居然还赖在这
Yeah. It's unbelievable. You're still here,

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.590
跟一坨屎一样  冲都冲不走
lingering like some big steaming shit that just won't flush.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:21.230
收到  目标已确认
Roger that.Target identified

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.400
你他妈就不能闭嘴吗
and how about you shut the fuck up?

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.680
确保少数族裔等弱势群体占有一定比例

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.680
这就是所谓的平权法案吧
Positive discrimination, that's what it is.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:27.700
垃圾学校的学生成绩差得很
It's like these fucking state school kids

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.410
但是照样能进牛津
who get into Oxford on C-grades,

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.420
就因为他老妈是个瘸子同性恋
'cause their mum is a one-legged lesbian.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.040
你又不知道我成绩什么样
You don't know fuck all about my grades.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.160

真是不好意思  公主殿下
Sorry, Your Royal Highness,

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:26.890
要想恢复斯堪的纳维亚半岛秩序
but you got a big role to play

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.910
您是不可缺少的一环
in getting the Scandinavian region back on track.

您备受尊敬  鼓舞人心
You're popular, inspirational,

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:33.990
还有强大的民众号召力
and you have the power to galvanize the people.

所以不管您合不合作
Now whether you're on board or not,

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.670
我都不得不坚持
I'm going to have to insist

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.970
将您安置在安全的地方
on getting you somewhere I can ensure your safety.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.040
那您呢  首相  您要参与吗
How about you, Prime Minister? You in or out?

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:48.240
身为一个政客  我觉得事到如今
Well, I think it's about time that a politician did something

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:52.250
该干点有意义的事了
that actually made a difference.

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.650
说得好
Too true.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:54.780
干嘛
What?

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.230
把她带走
Take her away.

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:01.070
喝一杯
Drink?

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.890
好啊
Why not?

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:10.330
别担心  公主不会受到任何伤害
Don't worry, no harm will come to the princess.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:12.090
反正我是共和党的[反王室]
Well, I am a republican anyway, so...

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:14.510
我又不在乎
it really doesn't matter.

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.350
放了公主

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:51.810

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:10.560
我偷东西踩点时才会敲门
Only when I'm casing the place to rob.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:12.920
梅林说你找我
Merlin said you wanted to see me?

我的老天  我都没使劲儿
Oh, for God's sake, I barely touched you...

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:46.430
你怎么这么...
Oh, man up...

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.540
我的老天

居然爆了他的头
You blew up his head?

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.630
有点过头了吧
It's a bit much, ain't it?

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:58.530
事实上是他颈部的植入芯片引起了爆炸
Actually the explosion was caused by an implant in his neck.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:45:59.960
就在伤疤下面
Here, under the scar.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.880
我的装备有捕捉到触发信号吗
My hardware picked up the signal that triggered it?

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.490
好消息是捕捉到了

我有必要去会会瓦伦丁先生了
I think Mr. Valentine and I should have a tête-à-tête.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:26.430
他下周要举办晚宴
He's having a gala dinner next week.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:28.170
我帮你搞定邀请函
I'll get you an invitation.

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:29.640
不过你千万要小心
You need to be careful, though.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.800
你昏迷后  数百名重要人物都离奇失踪
Since you've been out, hundreds of VIPs have gone missing,

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.560
也没有要求支付赎金...跟阿诺德教授一样
no ransom notes...exactly like Professor Arnold.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.740
那就帮我找个值得被绑架的身份吧
And I suggest you make my alias somebody worth kidnapping.

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:53.600
你怎么了  恐高吗
What, you don't like heights?

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.040
是啊  不过还好
Yeah, it's okay.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.050
我以前跳过伞  不过应该就是跳过才害怕
I've done it before, which is probably why, come to think of it.

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.870
放心吧  你会没事的
Hey, you're gonna be all right.

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.260
你可是班里成绩最好的
You're top of the class.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.150
听好了
Listen up.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:07.860
你们的任务是准确降落在目标地点
You mission is to land on the target

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.650
但不能被雷达发现
without the radar detecting you.

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.770
一旦被雷达发现或者偏移目标
I read you on the radar or you miss the target,

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:13.010
卷铺盖走人
you go home.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.100
都听懂了吧
Is that understood?

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.730
20秒后抵达跳伞区域
Drop zone coming up, 20 seconds.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.360
走吧
We gotta go.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:35.110
艾格西  我觉得我做不到
Eggsy. I really don't think I can do this.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:36.180
你当然做不到
Of course you can't.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.060
去后面待着  先看我的吧
Head to the back and I'll show you how, yeah?

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.850
来吧
Come on!

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.670
艾格西  艾格西  等等
Eggsy. Eggsy, wait! Hang on!

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.430
罗克茜  别这么婆婆妈妈
Roxy, just stop fucking about!

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:53.470
跟着我就好  明白吗
Follow me, yeah?

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.180
爽
Come on!

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.510
罗克茜  再不跳就没戏了
Roxy, it's now or never!

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:14.540
跳
Jump!

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:35.960
好姑娘  罗克茜  干得漂亮
Good girl, Roxy! I'm glad you made it!

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.720
看我的
Look at me.

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:53.030
你们也来吧
Come on.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.570
哎呦  你们心情都不错嘛
My, my, you're all very cheerful.

00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:59.870
真以为这么一帆风顺就过了吗
You really think it was gonna be that straight forward?

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:02.370
送到眼前的情报谁不会看
Any idiot can read a heads-up display,

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:03.780
要想成为王牌特工
but Kingsman agent needs to be able to

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.060
得学会在高压环境下解决问题
solve problems under pressure...

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:10.610
比如有人没有降落伞该怎么办
like what to do when one of your group has no parachute.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:12.350
-什么  -操
- What? - Shit!

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:14.500
谁没降落伞
No parachute? Who?

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.750
该死
Fuck!

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:16.880
到底是谁
Which one?

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.070
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.640
再说一次  找准目标  避开雷达
I told you, aim for the target, coming under the radar.

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.990
我也不想把谁从地上铲起来
And I hope not to be scraping one of you out.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:26.710
但如果你真能摔进目标里
But if I do have to and you're inside the target...

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:29.320
至少我会刮目相看的
please know I'll be very impressed.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.300
-该死  -见鬼
- Fuck! - Shit!

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:36.710
大家都听着  我有个计划
Everybody listen, I've got a plan.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.500
两人一组  抓住离你最近的人
Pair up! Grab the closest person to.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:45.880
-鲁夫斯  抓住我  -该死
- Rufus, come on! - Oh, fuck!

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:47.940
鲁夫斯
Rufus!

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.680
见鬼  我做不到
Oh shit, I can't!

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.500
该死
Fuck!

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:56.490
谢天谢地
Thank God!

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.320
鲁夫斯  你个缩头乌龟
Rufus, you wanker!

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.620
见鬼  现在是奇数了
Shit, we're in odd number now!

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:03.030
快  所有人围成一个圈
Quick, make a circle.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.000
说得对  各位  快
Fuck. Right, boys, let's do it.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.860
我们轮流打开降落伞
We pull our chords one by one.

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.100
找到那个倒霉蛋后
when we know who's fucked,

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.240
右手边的人就抓住他
the person on the right grabs him.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.660
好的  艾格西
Okay, Eggsy.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:19.390
好主意  艾格西
Good plan, Eggsy.

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.590
你还剩三十秒  加油  快
You have 30 seconds. Come on now, hurry!

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:23.100
我先来
Me first!

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.140
该死
Oh, fuck!

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.020
警告

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.190
高度过低

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.210
好了  下个我来
Okay, me next.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.590
地面上见  伙计们
See you on the ground, boys.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:40.290
该我了
Now me.

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.710
该死
Fuck!

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.370
罗克茜
Rox,

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:52.880
无论如何我都会保护你  明白吗
no matter what happens now, I've got you, all right?

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:54.340
警告

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:54.340
高度过低

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:57.410
明白  艾格西
Okay, Eggsy.

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.250
-你先来行吗  -好
- Yours first, okay? - Yeah.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.710
该死
Shit!

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.760
糟糕
Shit!

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:23.740
警告

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:23.740
高度过低

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.350
见鬼
Shit!

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:27.550
罗克茜
Rox!

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:50.990
雨果  迪格比
Hugo. Digby.

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:53.500
进不了目标就做不了特工
You don't land in the K, you're not in the K.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.340
鲁夫斯  降落伞开太早
Rufus, you opened too soon.

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.920
怕雷达上看不到你吗
You're all over the radar.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.900
你们三个  收拾行李回家吧
All three of you, pack your bags and go home.

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:04.390
艾格西  罗克茜  祝贺你们
Eggsy, Roxy. Congratulations.

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:05.770
你们刷新了记录
You set a new record.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.810
可不是谁都敢降到300英尺才开降落伞
Opening at 300 feet, that's pretty ballsy.

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.680
恭喜你们完成又一项任务  解散
Well done for completing another task. Fall out.

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:13.560
不好意思  先生
Sorry, sir.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.350
你凭什么选我当倒霉蛋
But why the fuck did you choose me as the gim?

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:16.620
你觉得我可以牺牲掉吗
Am I the expendable candidate?

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:18.840
不准你那么跟我说话
No, no, no. You don't talk to me like that.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:22.610
有什么牢骚  过来悄悄跟我说
You have a complaint, you come here and you whisper in my ear.

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.310
我给你消消气
You need to take that chip off your shoulder.

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:05.390
德维尔先生  见到您真高兴
Mr. De Vere. It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:08.050
真不好意思  是我记错晚宴时间了吗
I'm awfully sorry. I seem to have my dates muddled up.

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:08.840
不  不  不
Oh, no, no, no.

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.590
我专门为您取消了晚宴
I cancelled the gala because of you.

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:15.020
这么大手笔的捐赠  当然得单独宴请
Anybody willing to donate that much deserves their own dinner.

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.020
请进吧
Come in.

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:18.030
多谢了
Thank you.

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.840
不得不承认我非常期待见到您
Gotta admit I was really intrigued to meet you.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.860
我不认识的亿万富翁真不多
There aren't many billionaires I don't know.

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:25.840
肯定
I don't doubt it.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:29.580
我找人查了下您的资料
Obviously, I had my people looked into your fair and...

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.290
发现您来自一个富贵世家
that's some pretty old money you're from.

00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:32.340
你们的钱是怎么赚的啊
How did you folks make it?

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.690
大部分是地产  还有期货市场
Property, mostly. Property and the markets.

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:37.420
您不用担心  没有来路不明的钱
Nothing questionable, if that's your concern.

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:38.370
不是这个意思
Oh, no.

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:40.890
我只是想了解您有多少身家
No. I'm just into finding out what caliber person you are,

00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:42.030
您应该能理解的吧
I assume you understand that.

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:43.310
当然
I most certainly do.

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:45.030
-您一定饿了吧  -饿坏了
- Hope you're hungry. - I'm famished.

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:47.090
那就好  请坐
Good. Grab a seat.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.580
-请给我巨无霸  -眼光不错
- I'll have the Big Mac, please. - Great choice,

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.930
但要说最好
but nothing beats

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:15.060
还是搭配秘制酱料的双吉士堡餐
two cheeseburgers with secret sauce.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.310
和1945年的拉菲葡萄酒是绝配
It's goes great with this '45 Lafite.

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.390
经典组合
A classic pairing.

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:19.450
至于餐后甜点
And may I suggest Twinkies

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.320
可以试试1947年的滴金贵腐甜白
and 1947' Château d'Yquem

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.300
配奶油夹心蛋糕
for pudding?

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.250
这个我喜欢
I like it.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.820
话说回来  您想捐款给我的基金会
So, you want to donate to my foundation.

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.700
您应该知道那方面的研究已经暂缓了吧
You are aware that I wound things down in that area, right?

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.580
可气候变化对我们来说都是威胁
Climate change is a threat which affects us all,

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:34.780
瓦伦丁先生
Mr. Valentine.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.270
有权势的人没几个赞同我的
And you're one of the few powerful man

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:37.810
而您是其中之一
who seems to share my concern.

00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:40.960
我之所以关停是因为毫无进展
I shut things down because I wasn't getting anywhere.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.940
每一项研究都指向同一个结果
Every bit of research just pointing to the same thing.

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.370
碳排放只是个烟雾弹
The carbon emissions are a red herring

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:47.090
恐怕现在无论怎么补救
and we're way past the point of no return

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:49.200
都是无济于事了
no matter what remedial actions we take.

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.070
你挺明白啊
You know your shit.

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:53.710
其实有时我还挺嫉妒那些
I sometimes envy the blissfully ignorance of those less,

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.530
对这个世界不是那么...
well versed in their...

00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:56.460
明白的人
shit.

00:55:57.810 --> 00:55:59.920
阿诺德教授常说
As Professor Arnold always said,

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.030
"人类是唯一一种
"Human kind is the only virus cursed

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:04.320
知道宿主经不起折腾的
to live with the horrifying knowledge of its host's

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.980
可怜病毒"
fragile mortality."

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.380
知道阿诺德教授的人可不多
You know, not a lot people knew about him.

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:15.040
您喜欢看间谍片吗  德维尔先生
You like spy movies, Mr. De Vere?

00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:21.290
现代的间谍片我觉得太严肃了
Nowadays, they're all a little serious, to my taste.

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:24.280
老片子更精彩
The old ones. Marvelous.

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.000
虽然剧情牵强夸张  但我看不厌
Give me a far-fetched theatrical plot any day.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.240
邦德系列电影啊
The old Bond movies! Oh, man!

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:34.440
我小时候就梦想成为他
When I was a kid, that was my dream job.

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:36.570
绅士间谍
Gentlemen spy.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.020
我认为邦德系列里最出彩的还是反派
I always felt the old Bond film were only as good as the villain.

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:41.630
我小时候
As a child, I rather

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:44.450
倒是想做一个放眼未来的自大狂
fancied a future as a colourful meglaomaniac.

00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:49.180
只可惜我们都得长大
What a shame we both had to grow up.

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:55.910
用餐愉快
Bon appétit.

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.590
给我几天时间来考虑您的提议
Just give me a couple of days to think over your proposal,

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:05.030
然后我派人与您手下联系  就没问题了
I'll have my people get in touch with yours, and it's all good.

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:08.430
也谢谢您的...欢乐餐
And thank you for such a...Happy Meal.

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:15.420
怎么样  要我跟踪他吗
Well? Want me to follow him?

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.920
用不着
Nah.

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:19.380
我在酒里下了微型追踪器
I put a nano tracker gel in the wine.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.610
他接下来24小时做了什么我们都会知道
We'll know his every move for the next 24 hours,

怎么  你觉得瓦伦丁支持他们吗
What, you think Valentine is a supporter?

目前还没有证据表明双方有联系
No evidence yet of direct connection,

00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:46.070

进行负面评价  降低她的社交价值

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.670
用一个中性问题来让你开口
Got you talking with a neutral question.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.370
让我们所有人都卷进对话里
Got the whole of us involved in the conversation,

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:18.840
好让你急于吸引他的注意力
so that you craved individual attention.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.500
我只是说这酒喝着不太对
No, I'm just saying the champagne tastes wrong.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:24.260
苏菲·蒙太古·哈灵女士  前台有您的电话

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:35.700
还有个简单得多的办法
easier way to guarantee getting someone home.

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:37.620
比如迷药
Rohypnol.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.050
或者药效更强的
Or even something stronger.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.740
你他妈谁啊
Who the fuck are you?

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:02.740
我在哪

-操  -我的雇主有两个问题  艾格西
- Fuck. - My employer's got two questions for you, Eggsy.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:21.110
王牌特工是什么鬼  谁是哈利·哈特
What the fuck is Kingsman, and who's Harry Hart?

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.050
我不知道你说的是谁  该死
I don't know what the fuck that is. Shit.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.560
艾格西  我刚刚
Eggsy, I just killed two of

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.600
处决了你的两个朋友  他们全都是这套屁话
your friends who give me the same bullshit answer.

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:32.490
我操  快他妈把绳子切断  求你了
Fuck. Just cut the fucking ropes, please.

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:35.660
艾格西  王牌特工真值得你送死吗
Eggsy, is Kingsman worth dying for?

01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:40.390
去你妈的
Fuck you!

王牌特工真值得你送死吗
Is Kingsman really worth dying for?

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:15.390
值得才怪  我全都告诉你  求你了
No, it fucking isn't! Shit, I'll tell you what you want, please.

01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:17.130
切斯特·金是亚瑟
Chester King is Arthur.

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:19.270
亚瑟是名为王牌特工的特工组织的头目
Arthur is the head of a spy agency and it's called Kingsman.

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:22.750
-快放开我  -多谢你查理  万分感谢
- Get me out of here. - Thank you Charlie. Much appreciated.

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:25.680
不  你说话不算数
No! That wasn't the fucking deal.

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.140
我还对你寄予厚望
I had such high hopes for you.

01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:39.190
真是丢人
You're a bloody disgrace.

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:42.350
亚瑟  对不起  解开我吧
Arthur, I'm sorry, please untie me.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.220
自己解去

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.020
亚瑟  亚瑟  求你了
Arthur, Arthur, please.

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:51.870

依照传统  给你们24小时的时间共处
As traditional goes, you now have 24 hours to spend with them.

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:07.840
艾格西  要知道你父亲当年也到了这一关
Eggsy, you should know your father reached this point.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.940
从现在起  都是真枪实弹了  明白吗
From now on, there are no safety nets, understood?

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:16.650
很好  解散吧
Good, dismissed.

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.480
查理  该回家了
Charlie, time to go home.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.720
去你妈的  看我不叫我爸来整你们
Fuck you, my fucking dad's gonna heard about this.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.980
尿  还是不尿
To pee or not to pee?

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.500
那是我在巴黎
That was the headline the

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.980
成功拆除脏弹当天的报纸头条
day after I defused the dirty bomb in Paris.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.100
02世界杯预选赛

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:39.240
-德国1:5英格兰  -错过了那场比赛
- Germany 1, England 5. - Missed that game.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.080
我当时正在五角大楼瓦解卧底间谍组织
I was breaking up an undercover spy ring at the Pentagon.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.010
1981.7.29  查尔斯王子与戴安娜王妃婚礼

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:48.920
我第一个任务
My first mission.

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.710
挫败了针对玛格丽特·撒切尔的刺杀行动
Foiled the assassination of Margaret Thatcher.

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:53.950
这事可有人不想感谢你
Not everybody had thanked you for that one.

01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:54.920
关键在于  艾格西
The point is, Eggsy,

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.670
根本就没人谢过我
nobody thanked me for any of them.

01:03:57.350 --> 01:04:00.780
这些事当天的报纸头条都是些名流的花边新闻
Front page news in all these occasions were celebrity nonsense.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.060
我认为身为王牌特工
I think it's the nature of

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.560
取得了成就也不该为人知
Kingsman that our achievements remain secret.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.370
一位绅士的名字
A gentleman's name should

01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:08.530
应该只在报纸上出现三次
appear in the newspaper only three times.

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:11.180
出生时  结婚时  过世时
When he's born, when he marries, and when he dies.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.880
而身为王牌特工  首先是一位绅士
And we are first and foremost gentlemen.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:18.290
那我没指望了  就跟查理说的似的
It's me fucked then. It's like Charlie said.

01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:19.930
-我就是个下等人  -胡说
- I'm just a pleb. - Nonsense.

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:20.680
是不是绅士
Being a gentleman has nothing

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.440
和一个人的出身没有任何关系
to do with the circumstances of one's birth.

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:25.920
绅士风度是学来的
Being a gentleman is something one learns.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.500
怎么学
Yeah, but how?

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:30.520
好吧  第一课
All right, first lesson.

01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:32.580
你坐下之前要先征求我的许可
You should've asked me before you took a seat.

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:35.120
第二课
Second lesson,

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.630
学会调正宗的马提尼
how to make a proper martini.

01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:39.460
好的  哈利
Yes, Harry.

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:46.400
见鬼  疼死个人了
Goddamn it. This fucking hurts.

01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:49.050
是你自己非要装生物特征识别系统的
You are the one who ask for a biometric security system.

01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:51.450
-装个按钮不行吗  -按钮
- What's wrong with a simple switch? - A simple switch?

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:55.060
这可是一台极其危险的机器
This is an extremely dangerous machine.

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.520
操作它的人
It should only be operated

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.030
只能是我这样又负责又理智的人
by someone as responsible and sane as me.

01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:03.150
如果落进坏蛋手里  那就糟啦
Bad shit could happen if this falls into the wrong hand.

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:09.590
-完事了吗  疼死了  -没  还有这个
- We done here? Shit. - No. Now this one.

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:11.300
教堂测试的开关
For the test of the church.

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:15.380
这个范围很小  装个按钮就够了
This one does have a short range, a simple switch will do.

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:23.860
你要不要教我《窈窕淑女》里那种腔调
So you're gonna teach me how to talk proper like My Fair Lady?

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.310
别犯傻
Don't be absurd.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.360
绅士和口音没有关系
Being a gentleman has nothing to do with one's accent,

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.870
关键在于接受现在的自己
it's about being at ease in one's own skin.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:31.800
正如海明威所说
As Hemmingway said,

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.830
优于别人  并不高贵
there's nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man,

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.590
真正的高贵是优于过去的自己
true nobility is being superior to your former self.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:46.250
那么  绅士必备品第一件  合体西装
Now, first thing every gentleman needs is a good suit,

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:49.560
我指的是全定制西装  绝不要买成衣
by which I mean a bespoke suit, never off-the-peg.

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:52.090
王牌特工的西装都是防弹的
And Kingsman's suits are always bulletproof.

01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:54.880
你先去量量尺寸  无论你能不能通过考核
So let's get you measured and whether you get the job or not,

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.650
你都能有一件长久
you'll have a lasting and

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.380
且有用的纪念品  纪念在这的时光
useful memento of your time at Kingsman.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:03.450
实在抱歉  先生  另一位先生正在试衣
I'm so sorry, sir. But a gentleman is completing his fitting.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.830
二号试衣室可用
Fitting Room 2 is available.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.840
第一次可不能在二号试衣室凑合
One does not use Fitting Room 2 when one is popping one's cherry.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.230
要不我先带你去三号试衣室看一看
Perhaps I'll show you Fitting Room 3, while we wait.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.340
-这次是向上还是向下  -都不是
- So we're going up or down? - Neither.

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:30.080
-就这样吗  -当然不是
- This is it? - Of course not.

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.240
拉一下你左边的挂钩
Pull the hook on your left.

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:43.100
棒  真是棒
Oh, yes, very, very nice.

01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:48.630
你需要一双好鞋来搭配西装
You're going to need a pair of shoes to go with your suit.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:52.680
鞋耳根部不缝在鞋面上的系带正装鞋都叫牛津鞋
An Oxford is any formal shoe with open lacing,

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:52.680
此处存疑  牛津鞋的英文维基页面说"closed lacing"
即鞋耳根部与鞋面缝在一起

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.220
这装饰性的花纹就叫雕花
this additional decorative piece is called Brogueing.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.590
牛津鞋  不雕花
Oxfords, not brogues.

01:06:57.590 --> 01:07:00.810
受用一生啊  艾格西  受用一生
Words to live by, Eggsy, words to live by.

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:02.310
穿一双试试
Try a pair.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.480
顺便说一句  你武器课程分数蛮高的嘛
Your weapon scores are excellent, by the way.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.190
这些你都见过了
These you're familiar with,

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.160
而这是我们的标准配枪
and this is our standard issue pistol.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.120
可以看出外形不同寻常
It's quite unique as you'll see it,

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.530
在混乱的近战环境下还能发射霰弹
it also fires shot gun cartridge for use in messy close range situations.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.000
-感觉怎样  -挺好的
- How do they feel? - Yeah, good.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.290
现在你尽力模仿一下
Now do your very best impersonation

01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:19.790
德国贵族式的正礼
of a German aristocrat's formal greeting.

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:24.160
错  艾格西
No, Eggsy.

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.350
太牛逼了
That is sick.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.590
过去鞋跟里还装着移动电话
In the old days they had a phone in the heels as well.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:33.620
该怎么缩回去
How do I get it back in?

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:34.400
刀刃上涂了一层
Well it's coated with one of

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.450
发作速度最快的神经毒素  所以...
the fastest acting neurotoxins known to man, so...

01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:39.130
千万小心
very carefully.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.000
这东西我玩过许多次了
Now, I've had a lot of fun with this.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.790
是我们顶尖化工技术的结晶
One of our finest examples of chemical engineering.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.680
这种毒药服下后是无害的
A poison, harmless when ingested,

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:55.810
但你完全可以视情形需要远程激活
but at a time convenient to you, can be remotely activated.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.610
随时可以致命
Primed, lethal.

01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:03.050
那这些呢  是做什么用的
What about these? What do these do?

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:06.260
-电击器吗  -别逗了  那是手榴弹
- Electrocute you? - Don't be ridiculous. That's a hand grenade.

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.020
不是吧
Shut up.

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:09.360
想电人的话  要用印章戒指
You want to electrocute someone, you'll need a signet ring.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.710
传统上  绅士把印章戒指戴在左手
A gentleman traditionally wears the signet ring on his left hand,

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:12.570
但王牌特工
but a Kingsman wears it

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:14.820
都戴在惯用手上
on which ever hand happens to be dominant.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.090
按下戒指上的触点  就会发出五万伏电压
Touch the contact behind the ring, it delivers 50,000 Volts.

01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:23.020
-那些呢  有什么特殊的地方  -没什么
- And what about them? What makes them so special? - Nothing.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.400
是大众科技终于追上了间谍科技的步伐
That technology's caught up with the spy world.

01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:28.760
放回去  艾格西
Put it back, Eggsy.

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:34.500
正好  那位先生试衣结束了
Ah, perfect timing. The gentleman's just finished.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:45.040
德维尔先生  好巧啊
Mr. De Vere, what a coincidence.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.250
我就是因为你来的
You are totally the reason I'm here.

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:49.250
你从我家走了之后
When you left my house,

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:53.310
我就特想弄件你那样帅爆了的晚礼服
I was thirsting for that dope ass smoking jacket you had on.

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:55.200
我要去皇家爱斯科赛马会
And since I'm going to Royal Ascot,

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.650
必须得穿这种正装吧
apparently you need one of these penguin suits.

01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.710
所以我就来了  你来干什么了
Here I am. What are you doing here?

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.380
你好啊哥们  我是里士满·瓦伦丁
What's up man? Richmond Valentine.

01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:06.570
这是我新招的随扈  我带他来见我的裁缝
This is my new valet, I was just introducing him to my tailor.

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.210
太巧了  我也是
Another coincidence. So am I.

01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:12.280
您又考虑我的提议了吗
Have you had any chance to think further on my proposal?

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.580
当然了
Most definitely.

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.470
我的人
My people will be getting

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:17.880
很快会和你联系的  我保证
in touch with you very soon. I guarantee it.

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:22.600
提个建议  去皇家赛马会还需要戴大礼帽
A word of advise. Ascot requires top hat.

01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:27.340
我建议您去洛扣公司  定制礼帽
I might suggest Lock and Co., hatters.

01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:30.430
-圣詹姆斯街上  -烤鱼的烤
- St. James'. - Lox as in smoked fish?

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:32.330
锁扣的扣
As in 'locked up'.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.730
有时候真是听不懂你们说的话
I have trouble understanding you people some times.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.790
你们都  不好好说话
Y'all...talk so funny.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:50.500
先生们  他就麻烦你们了
Gentlemen, would you look after him, please.

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.430
这才是爆有型的礼帽
Now, this is a dope ass top hat.

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:12.220
瞪羚  咱们看赛马去
Gazelle, let's go Ascotting.

01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:15.490
怎么回事  瞪羚
What happened there, Gazelle?

01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:17.900
快点  我要让女王等我了
Come on, don't make me late for the queen.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.600
快走  瞪羚  要迟到了
Come on, Gazelle. We gonna be late.

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:24.850
赛马场多远  多远来着
How far is Ascot? How far?

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.970
-梅林说您想见我  长官  -请坐
- Merlin said you wanted to see me, sir? - Sit down.

01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:41.670
-小狗挺不错  叫什么  -JB
- Pretty dog. What's his name? - JB.

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:44.230
-詹姆斯·邦德的缩写  -不是
- As in James Bond? - No.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.480
-杰森·伯恩  -不  是杰克·鲍尔- Jason Bourne? - No, Jack Bauer.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.480
美剧《24小时》男主

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.270
选得好
Bravo.

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:53.340
虽然我不想承认  艾格西
It pains me to admitt it, Eggsy,

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.470
但我你也许有一天
but I think that one day

01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:57.070
也能成为和他们一样优秀的特工
you might be as good a spy as any of them.

01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:05.830
拿着
Take it.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.480
把狗打死
Shoot the dog.

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:26.970
枪上膛了  把狗打死
This weapon is live. Shoot the dog.

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:06.510
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:19.510
还是姑娘有胆子
At lease the girl's got balls.

01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:24.170
出去
Get out.

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:26.540
我就知道你不行
I knew you couldn't make it.

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.050
回家吧
Go home.

01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:35.470
梅林  请让罗克茜进来吧
Merlin, send in Roxy, please.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.030
欢迎加入王牌特工
Welcome, to Kingsman.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.660
兰斯洛特
Lancelot.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.290
-妈  -艾格西
- Mom. - Eggsy.

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:33.890
天啊你去哪了  我担心死你了
God, where you've been? I've been so worried about you.

01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:38.620
天啊  你都长这么大了
Oh my days, just look how big you grow.

01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:47.680
-他在哪  -我没事  艾格西
- Where is he? - I'm fine. Eggsy.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:48.820
求你了  求你别去惹他
Please, please, just don't get involved.

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.730
不  我就不该留下你一个人
No, I should've never have left you on your own.

01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:52.950
这事到此为止了
This stops right now.

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.650
-马上回来  -艾格西
- Be right back. - Eggsy.

01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:03.100
-迪恩  -小废物  你回来了
- Dean. - Oh, Mugsy, so you're back.

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.100
怎么  现在改偷出租车了
What, you nicked a fucking taxi now?

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.160
没错  我要跟你谈谈我妈眼上的伤
Yeah. Can I have a word about my mom's black eye.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:11.620
你还想跟我谈  你一下那出租车
You wanna have a word with me, you get out that cab,

01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.970
我立马打得你找不着北
I'll knock you staight back down your fucking ass.

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:18.120
先让你的狗腿子进去  然后我再出来
Tell your muppets to go inside, then I'll get out.

01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:21.860
去吧  小子们  两下就搞定了
Go on, lads. There'll be two hits.

01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:24.060
一下揍他  一下他倒地
Me hittin' him. And him hittin' the floor.

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.490
来吧  小兔崽子
Come on, then, you prick.

01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:29.070
看看你有什么本事  想打我
Let's see what you got, eh? Want a bit of me?

01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:32.190
-你干什么  -不  不  别这样
- What you're doing? - No, no, no. Come on.

01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:33.300
你干什么  你要去哪儿
What you're doing? Where you going?

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.670
你这个蠢货  就这么没种
You mug. What, you ain't got no bollocks?

01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:38.140
那家伙打了我妈妈
Come on, he hit my fucking mum!

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.790
等你带种了再来找我吧  蠢货
Come back when you've grown a pair. Muggsy.

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:08.640
你为了一只狗放弃了自己的大好前程
You throw away your biggest opportunity over a fucking dog.

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:12.400
然后你还偷了我老板的车给我蒙羞
And then you humiliate me by stealing my boss's car.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.380
你为了一份破工作就冲自己的狗开枪
You shot a dog just to get a fucking job.

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.650
没错
Yes, I did.

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:21.830
每次我上厕所看到泡菜  就想起当时的场景
And Mr. Pickle here reminds me of that every time I take a shit.

01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:26.640
你打死自己的狗还把它做成了标本吗
You shot your dog and had it stuffed?

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.450
你个变态
You fucking freak.

01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:29.750
不  我对我的狗开枪了
No, I shot my dog,

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:30.670
之后我把它带回家里
and then I brought him home and

01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:32.680
又继续养了它11年
continue to care for him for the next 11 years,

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.850
直到它死于胰腺炎
until he died of pancreatitis.

01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:37.670
-什么  -那是空弹  艾格西
- What? - It was a blank, Eggsy.

01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:40.270
只是发空弹
It was a fucking blank.

01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:43.480
-你还记得阿米莉亚吗  -记得
- Remember Amelia? - Yeah.

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.850
她并没有淹死
She didn't drown.

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:46.780
她是我们柏林技术部门的人
She works in our tech department in Berlin.

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.740
还活得好好的
She's fine.

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.160
必须要测试你的极限
Limits must be tested,

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:52.010
除非需要你救人一命  否则不能牺牲他人
Kingsman only condone the risking of a life to save another.

01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:54.780
比如你疏忽了  我爸却牺牲生命救你吗
Like my dad saved your life, even though your fuck-up cost his?

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:56.950
你怎么不把他也做成标本放在这儿
What, you got him stuffed here and all?

01:15:58.920 --> 01:15:59.720
你看不出来我做的一切
Can't you see that everything

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.160
都是为了报答他的救命之恩吗
I've done has been about trying to repay him?

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.270
哈利  你听这个
Harry, listen to this.

01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:11.380
瓦伦丁终于说了点有用的了
Valetine's at last saying something of note.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.120
你们知道我为什么喜欢笔和纸吗
You know what I love about pen and paper?

01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:16.830
因为没人能入侵
Nobody can hack into this shit.

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:20.800
我们的环球之旅是一个巨大的成功
Our world wide tour was a complete success.

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:23.600
该到手的都到手了
We have total coverage.

01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:27.460
英国
女王
爱丁堡公爵
威尔士亲王
康沃尔公爵夫人
剑桥公爵及公爵夫人
乔治王子
哈利王子

01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:26.560
就像玩宾戈的时候  把数字全划掉一样
Like when all your numbers in bingo are crossed out.

01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:27.530
宾戈
Bingo?

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:31.610
宾戈  那个数字游戏  你应该玩过吧
Bingo, the game, you have played bingo, right?

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.490
我可能玩那个吗
Do I look like I play bingo?

01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:37.180
关键是
The point is,

01:16:37.570 --> 01:16:39.920
如果明天教堂的实验顺利的话
if our test go well at the church tomorrow,

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.860
我们就可以行动了
we are good to go.

01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:44.210
南部林间教堂
South Glade Mission Church.

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:47.840
-梅林  准备好飞机  -好
- Merlin get the plane ready. - Will do.

01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:50.420
-哈利  对不起  我  -你确实该道歉
- Harry, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna do... - You should be.

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:51.710
你老实待在这儿
You just stay right there,

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.520
等我解决了问题再收拾你
I'll sort this mess up when I get back.

01:16:55.590 --> 01:17:00.800
肯塔基 美国

01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:02.710
我告诉你们  看看这世界吧
And I say to you, bear witness.

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:06.770
看看新闻  艾滋病
Watch the news. Watch the news. AIDS,

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:10.740
洪水  无辜之人泼洒鲜血
floods, the blood of the innocent spilled.

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:16.100
还有人怀疑这不是上帝在降怒吗
And yet, there are those who doubt this is the wrath of God.

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:24.550
我们堕落的政府纵容鸡奸  离婚  堕胎
Our filthy government condones sodomy, divorce, abortion,

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:30.850
还有人在怀疑  这不是伪基督干的吗
and yet some still doubt, this is work of the Antichrist.

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:33.040
哪怕你不是犹太人
You do not have to be a Jew,

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.220
黑人  妓女
a nigga, a whore, or an

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:39.420
或是信仰科学的进化论支持者...
atheistic science-loving evolution spouter...

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:40.820
说得真好
Charming sermon.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.890
你能看到瓦伦丁吗
Can you see Valetine anywhere?

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:47.980
朋友们  虽然他是公正的上帝  却也会...
So my friends, although he is a just God, he is a vengeful one...

01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:54.310
你能肯定我们在范围外吗
You're sure we're out of range?

01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:55.990
离那一千多英尺呢  怎么了
We're over thousand feet away, what's wrong?

01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:57.550
要是计算有误怎么办
What if the calculations are wrong?

01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:59.050
你只要相信我就好了
You just have to trust me.

01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:02.990
犹太人  黑人  还有同性恋
Jew, niggar, fag lovers

01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:06.960
撒旦会让他们永世受烈焰煎熬
and the devil is burning them for all eternity.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.590
-请让一下  -你要去哪儿
- Excuse me. - Where're you going?

01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:12.420
你搞什么
What's your problem?

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.300
我是一个信奉天主教的男妓
I'm a Catholic whore currently enjoying a congress out of wedlock

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:18.990
还和一个犹太裔的黑人搞婚外情
with my black jewish boyfriend

01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:21.270
他在一家军方的流产门诊部工作
who works at a military abortion clinic.

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.600
撒旦万岁
So hail Satan.

01:18:23.670 --> 01:18:25.510
祝您有一个愉快的下午  夫人
And have a lovely afternoon, madam.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.260
天哪  他要走了  我得马上开始实验
Oh, shit, he's leaving, I'm starting the test now.

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:35.000
但愿这群蠢货没少领SIM卡
Hope enough of these freaks have our SIM cards.

01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:44.520
你个异教徒要是就这么走了
You just leave this church like the infidel you are.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:50.010
你会吞食你的后代
You will eat your babies...

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:56.380
主的血液会淹没你的  主不会拯救你
You will drown in the blood of the Lord. He will not save you.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.970
我操
Oh fuck.

01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:06.260
天哪  我不能看这个  到这儿来
Oh shit, I can't watch this. Get over here.

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.180
天哪  不是吧
Jesus, fuck.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.050
加拉哈德  你能听到我说话吗
Galahad, can you hear me?

01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:54.790
哈利
Harry.

01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.110
哈利  这是怎么回事
Harry, what the heck is going on?

01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:00.470
你能把声音关小点吗
Can you just turn the volume down, please?

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.330
没想到效果这么好
I didn't expect it to be that effective.

01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:05.090
这效果有多好
What kind of response are we talking?

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.020
100%
One hundred percent.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:11.150
不管领没领手机卡  所有人都被影响了吗
So everyone's been effected, whether they have a sim card or not?

01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:13.780
还能顺便消灭个王牌特工
And we get to add the benefit of wiping out the Kingsman.

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:15.120
还没死呢
Not yet.

01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:12.310
你该看看这个
Oh, you need to see this.

01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:12.650
你对我做了什么  我控制不了自己
What did you do to me? I had no control.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.410
我把那些人全杀了
I killed all those people.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:20.050
-而且是自愿的  -很聪明  是不是
- I wanted to. - Clever, isn't it?

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:23.100
简单来说  就是发射神经电信号
In simple terms, it's a neurological wave,

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.820
会大大激发人的侵略性
that triggers the center of aggression,

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.510
并且关闭人体的抑制机能
and switches off the inhibiters.

01:23:26.670 --> 01:23:30.130
通过你那免费SIM卡传播的吧
Transmitted through your nasty free sim cards I assume?

01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:34.790
你知道这像什么吗
You know what this looks like?

01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:38.670
就像我们都爱看的老电影
This like those old movies we both love.

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:41.020
现在我应该把自己的计划都告诉你
Now I'm gonna tell you my whole plan

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.080
然后想出一种
and then I'm gonna come up

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.050
复杂又古怪的方法杀你
with some absurd and convoluted way to kill you

01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:48.270
可你会想出一个同样绝妙的方式逃脱
and you'll find an equally convoluted way to escape.

01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:50.400
我觉得可以这样
Sounds good to me.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.200
可这不是那种电影
Well, this ain't that kind of movie.

01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:59.620
不
No!

01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:08.900
他死了吗
Is he dead?

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.090
冲人脑袋开一枪  一般都会死的
That tends to happen when you shoot someone in the head.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:14.980
-感觉不错吧  -不  一点都不好
- It feels good, right? - No, it does not feel good.

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:16.040
感觉糟透了
It feels fucking awful.

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:18.630
什么  教堂里多少人都是你杀的
What? You just killed how many people in that church?

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.640
-这才一个  -不  那些人是自相残杀
- This is one guy. - No, no, no, they killed each other.

01:24:24.630 --> 01:24:28.010
好了  设好倒计时  我们的派对
Okay, send down the countdown clock. This party starts...

01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:29.330
明天开始
tomorrow.

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.210
亚瑟
Arthur.

01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:10.960
-你在吗  -很不幸  我在
- Are you there? - Sadly, I am.

01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:14.170
召集所有王牌特工
Assemble the Kingsmen.

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.240
你难道看不出来我做的一切
Can't you see that everything

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.630
都是为了报答他的救命之恩吗
I've done has been about trying to repay him?

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.890
是个充满潜力的小伙子
I see a young man with potential,

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.900
这辈子想做点好事
who wants to do something good in his life.

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.260
亚瑟  哈利死了
Arthur, Harry's dead.

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:14.760
加拉哈德死了  我们刚敬了他一杯
Galahad is dead. Hence, we have just drunk a toast to him.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.990
那你也知道那个疯子要做什么吧
Well, then you know what that psycho's doing.

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:20.190
全世界有多少人领了他的手机卡
How many people around the world have got those SIM cards?

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.980
瓦伦丁可以把信号发给他们任何一个人
Valentine can send his signal to any of them, all of them,

01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.050
一旦他们都开始自相残杀
if they all go homicidal at the same time, then...

01:26:25.050 --> 01:26:27.550
是啊  多亏了加拉哈德的录像
Indeed, and thanks to Galahad's recordings,

01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:29.600
我们拿到了瓦伦丁的供词
we have Valentine's confession.

01:26:30.330 --> 01:26:33.910
情报已经递交给了有关部门
The intellegence have been passed on to the relevant authorities,

01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:35.410
我们的任务完成了
our work is complete.

01:26:35.410 --> 01:26:39.470
这也是我们死去的战友留下的珍贵遗产
And a most distinguished legacy for our fallen friend it is too.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.880
就这样吗
And that's it?

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.430
来  坐下  孩子
Come and sit down, boy.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:52.870
这是1815年的拿破仑白兰地
This, is an 1815 Napoleonic Brandy.

01:26:53.710 --> 01:26:57.650
只有王牌特工中有人牺牲时  我们才会饮用
And we only drink it when we lose a Kingsman.

01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:59.870
加拉哈德很欣赏你
Galahad was very fond of you.

01:27:02.710 --> 01:27:06.580
这一次  我觉得我们可以适当地
And on this occasion, I think it's acceptable for us,

01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:09.260
破一下例
to bend the rules a little.

01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:12.400
那些都是王牌特工吗
These are all Kingsmen?

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:14.400
是的  他们是创始人
Yes, they're founder members.

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:18.470
咱们两个敬杯酒
I want you to join me in a toast.

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.860
敬加拉哈德
To Galahad.

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:24.590
敬加拉哈德
To Galahad.

01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:31.680
哈利说你不喜欢破例  亚瑟
Harry said you don't like to break rules, Arthur.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:33.640
现在为什么破例
Why now?

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.360
你表现很好  艾格西
You're very good, Eggsy.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.710
也许我会提议由你来接替加拉哈德的职位
Perhaps I will make you my proposal for Galahad's position.

01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:40.850
当然了  前提是你和我
Provided of course, if we can

01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:44.790
能在一些政治问题上达成共识
see eye to eye on certain political matters.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.310
你来猜一猜  这是什么
Can you guess, what this is?

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:53.970
我不用猜  哈利告诉过我了
I don't have to, Harry showed me.

01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:55.570
你一按  我就死
You click it, I die.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.910
我就觉得那白兰地味道有点怪
I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit.

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.880
-很好  -瓦伦丁收买了你
- Bravo. - Valentine won you over, somehow.

01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:06.870
他一解释  我就明白了
Once he explained, I understood.

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.910
你感染上病毒  就会发烧
When you get a virus, you get a fever,

01:28:09.930 --> 01:28:11.250
这是人体通过升温
that's the human body raising

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:13.810
来杀灭病毒
it's core temperature to kill the virus.

01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:16.330
地球也是一样
Planet Earth works the same way.

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:21.190
全球变暖是地球在发烧  而人类正是病毒
Global warming is the fever. Mankind is the virus.

01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:24.050
我们让地球病了
We're making our planet sick.

01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:26.380
只能寄希望于大清洗
A cull is our only hope.

01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:29.300
如果不主动减少人口
If we don't reduce our population ourselves,

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.760
最终只有那么两种结局
there's only one or two ways this gonna go.

01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:36.100
宿主杀死病毒  或是病毒杀死宿主
The host kills the virus, or the virus kills the host.

01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:39.460
-不管哪一种  -结果都是一样的
- Either way... - The result is the same.

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:41.890
病毒会被消灭
The virus dies.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.240
因此瓦伦丁决定亲自解决人口问题
So Valentine's gonna take care the population problem himself.

01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:49.140
就算我们不行动  大自然也会行动
But if we don't do something, nature will.

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:50.230
有时候  必须清洗掉低等人类
Sometimes the culling is the

01:28:50.230 --> 01:28:53.280
才能保证种族的繁衍
only way to ensure that the species survives.

01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:56.360
历史将会见证
And history will see Valentine

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:59.380
瓦伦丁拯救人类于灭顶之灾
as a man who saved humanity from extinction.

01:28:59.390 --> 01:29:02.490
所以他来决定清洗谁  是吗
And he gets to pick and choose who gets culled, does he?

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:04.270
他有钱的朋友都会活下来
All his rich mates they get to live,

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.510
他认为有价值活下去的人
and anyone he thinks is worth saving

01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:08.590
无论他们是否赞成  他都会保护他们
he's keeping them safe. Whether they agree with him or not.

01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:13.070
至于你  艾格西  看哈利的面子
And you, Eggsy, in Harry's honor,

01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:17.910
我邀请你成为新世界的一员
I am inviting you to be part of a new world.

01:29:20.690 --> 01:29:23.210
该做决定了
It's time to make your decision.

01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:33.390
我还是见哈利去吧  谢谢
I'd rathe be with Harry. Thanks.

01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:35.270
请便吧
So be it.

01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:56.630
我们这些平民  就是喜欢乱动东西
The problem with us common types is, that we're light fingered.

01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:01.300
王牌特工教会了我很多东西  可这种花招
Kingsmans taught me a lot, but... sleight of hand...

01:30:01.690 --> 01:30:03.630
是的  他们是创始人
Yes, they're founder members.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.750
我早就学会了
I had that down already.

01:30:09.810 --> 01:30:14.700
你这个小王八蛋
You dirty, little fucking prick.

01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:43.790
V日倒计时
速至安全区
或飞至
北纬66°58'30"
东经61°43'4"

01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:51.410
好了  兰斯洛特  把枪放下
It's okay, Lancelot, put it down.

01:30:52.170 --> 01:30:53.380
已经证实了
It's verified.

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:58.770
亚瑟手机收到的信息说找安全的地方
Arthur's phone's recieving update text about getting to safety.

01:30:58.770 --> 01:31:00.750
-我们的时间不多了  -你打算怎么办
- We don't have a lot of time. - What you're going to do?

01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:02.320
应该是我们打算怎么办
Question's what we gonna do?

01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:05.590
谁知道还有谁被瓦伦丁收买了
God knows who's in Valentine's pocket and who's not.

01:31:06.490 --> 01:31:07.740
我们没有办法
We've no choice.

01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:11.260
只能靠我们自己了
We're going to have to deal with it ourselves.

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.500
跟我来
Follow me.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:37.900
-这是什么玩意  -我不知道
- What the fuck is this? - I've no idea.

01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:40.460
你手里的这个家伙
What you're playing with,

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.210

01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.150
这种芯片可以按照指令
is it can also super heat

01:32:59.150 --> 01:33:01.250

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:38.280
必须在那之前部署好导弹  明白吗
You need to deploy the missile just before that, okay?

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.920

漂亮  你们都完成得很出色
Nice! Well done, both of you!

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:49.830
不起作用  应该可以启动的呀  怎么回事
It's not working! It's supposed to be working, what the fuck?

01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:58.850
做得好  罗克茜  真棒
Yes! Well done, Rox. Good girl!

01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:03.780
我们失去了一颗卫星
We've lost one of our satellites.

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.970
系统分析完成

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.970
模块扫描完成

01:44:14.210 --> 01:44:18.290
不不不  这我可破解不了
Oh, no, no! There's no way I can hack pass that!

01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:19.400
检测到生物特征识别防护

01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:19.400
模块扫描完成

01:44:23.610 --> 01:44:24.690
怎么回事
What's going on?

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.030
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.850
没必要拿枪指着我吧  我就是个飞行员
Come on. There's no need for guns. I'm just the pilot.

01:44:33.870 --> 01:44:34.490
操
Fuck!

01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:35.720

Come on!

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.770
-赶紧离开这  -不行
- Let's get the fuck out of here! - We can't.

01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:52.560
我侵入不了瓦伦丁的系统
I can't get into Valentine's machine.

01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:54.470
有生物特征识别系统
It's got biometric security.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:56.370
你还得再回去
You're gonna have to get in there

01:44:56.370 --> 01:44:58.690
别让他的手再碰到桌子
and make sure his hand never touches that desk.

01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:01.680
-你这是在逗我玩吗  -很遗憾  并不是
- Are you taking the fucking piss? - I'm afraid not.

01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:07.050
把这个给我
Let's have that, then?

01:45:07.890 --> 01:45:08.890
这是我的
This is mine.

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:11.040
你的装备在那边
I'll show you yours.

01:45:29.290 --> 01:45:30.280
选得好
Good choice.

01:45:32.590 --> 01:45:33.930
丢失连接

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:34.270
重连所有卫星还要多久
How long to relink the satellite chain?

01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:35.560
一小时  有可能两小时
It'll take an hour, maybe two.

01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:38.100
胡扯  把这俩连起来不就行了
Bullshit! Just bring these two closer together.

01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:39.910
但那颗不是你的
But that's not yours.

01:45:44.970 --> 01:45:46.500
V眼镜  呼叫E
V-glass, call E, man.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:51.370
E  我是V  听我说  我这遇到了点小麻烦
E! It's V. Listen man, I've got a little hiccup on this end,

01:45:51.370 --> 01:45:52.380
需要你帮个忙
I need a piggyback.

01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:53.800
我刚损失了颗卫星
One of my satellites just went down

01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:55.520
但它正好挨着你的卫星
but it's right next to one of yours.

01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.150
你真懂我
You're in my mind!

01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:00.750
你要多久能搞定
How long before you make that happen?

01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:04.680
行动
Go.

01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:10.740
好了  应该快好了
All right, we should be coming back online.

01:46:13.890 --> 01:46:15.080
10%
Ten percent.

01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:19.550
糟了  艾格西
Oh shit! Eggsy!

01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.520
瓦伦丁正在用别人的卫星
Valentine's using someone else's satellite.

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:22.840
他在重新连接卫星
He's gonna reconnect the chain.

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:24.940
应该用不了多久了
It's gonna take him no time at all.

01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:26.690
已经20%了
It's at twenty percent!

01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:46.820
艾格西  瓦伦丁为你准备了份大礼
Eggsy. Seems Valentine's got a present for you.

01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:48.010
你得抓紧了
Get a move on!

01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:22.730
那王牌特工小子死了吗
Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?

01:47:22.730 --> 01:47:24.480
还没有  不过快了
Not yet, but he will be soon.

01:47:24.490 --> 01:47:25.440
很好
Good.

01:47:39.170 --> 01:47:40.490
梅林  我死定了
Merlin, I'm fucked.

01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:54.400
我也是
As am I.

01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:55.380
他们两边包抄上来
They're coming at me from both sides.

01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:56.810
我无路可走了
I'm out of options.

01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:59.820
罗克茜  罗克茜  帮我个忙
Rox? Rox, I need a favour.

01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:03.400
打电话给我妈  让她把自己锁起来  远离迪恩
Call my mum, tell her to lock herself away from Dean...

01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:05.040
还有宝宝

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.500
告诉她  我爱她
And tell her I love her.

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.790
我操
Oh, for fuck's sake!

01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:25.530
梅林  还记得你说没用的芯片吗
Merlin, remember those implants you said were of no use to us?

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:28.570
你有办法激活吗
Any chance you can turn them on?

01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:35.570
对啊  轮到我玩你了  瓦伦丁
Right. My turn to play, Valentine.

01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:46.700
不不不  他在做什么
No. No, no! What the fuck is he...

01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:48.010
我没法阻止他
I can't stop this!

01:48:59.090 --> 01:49:00.470
激活植入安保芯片

01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:02.420
有劳了
Yes, please.

01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:06.600
植入安保芯片已激活

01:49:05.710 --> 01:49:07.480
不
No!

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:08.070
天呐  这画面真他妈太美了
Oh, my God! That is fucking spectacular!

01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:10.330
梅林  你真他妈是天才
Merlin you're a fucking genius!

01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:13.480
外面发生了什么事
What the fuck is happening out there?

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:19.870
你不是那个失踪的公主吗
Aren't you that princess who went missing?

01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:21.070
你能救我出去吗
Can you get me out?

01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:23.260
我救你的话  你能吻我一下吗
Well, if I do, will you give me a kiss?

01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:25.110
我一直想吻公主
I've always wanted to kiss a princess.

01:50:25.110 --> 01:50:27.660
你现在救我出去  可不只给你个吻
If you get me out right now, I'll give you more than just a kiss.

01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:30.890
你个混蛋
You motherfucker!

01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:32.370
你真的以为我会蠢到
Did you really think I was stupid enough

01:50:32.590 --> 01:50:35.310
给自己也植入那玩意儿吗
to implant one of those things in my own head?

01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:37.380
你他妈是疯了吗
What are you, fucking crazy?

01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:40.760
害死这么多无辜的人为了什么
All those innocent people killed, and for what?

01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:44.240
你根本阻止不了我
You didn't stop shit!

01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:47.430
好了  我把门锁好了  你还想要我做什么
Fine, I've locked the door. What do you want me to do now?

01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:48.720
我刚说了  把你女儿
As I said, put your daughter

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:50.930
锁进浴室里  再把钥匙扔了
in the bathroom and throw away the key.

01:50:51.170 --> 01:50:53.650
计划照常进行
It's still happening!

01:50:53.650 --> 01:50:55.080
你他妈是疯了吗
Are you fucking insane?

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.350
照做就行了
Just do it.

01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:24.930
艾格西  信号开始发射了
Eggsy! The signal's starting!

01:51:24.930 --> 01:51:28.330
快别让瓦伦丁摸那桌子了
Get Valentine's hand off that bloody desk now!

01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:30.840
抱歉  美女  我得去拯救世界了
Sorry, love. Gotta save the world.

01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:34.420
如果你拯救了世界  我可以让你玩后面
If you save the world, we can do it in the asshole.

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:36.970

这玻璃撑不了多久
That glass's not gonna hold long.

01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:51.150
你在这待着
Just stay here.

01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:55.530
梅林  快告诉我怎么上去
Merlin, quickly. How do I get up there?

01:52:55.530 --> 01:52:56.870
继续射击  我找条路
Keep shooting, I'll find a route.

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:57.890
明白
Understood.

01:53:14.050 --> 01:53:15.330
我操

首尔  加拉加斯  孟买...
Seoul. Caracas. Mumbai...

01:54:15.610 --> 01:54:18.240
杀了那混蛋  他把我们的朋友都害死了
Kill that motherfucker! He killed all our friends!

01:54:34.930 --> 01:54:37.820

你好呀
'Sup, man?

01:57:59.630 --> 01:58:03.190
你是不是该说个烂透了的冷笑话
Is this the part where you say some really bad pun...

01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:05.950
就像你对哈利说的
Just like you said to Harry?

01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:11.530
这可不是那种电影  哥们
This ain't that kind of movie, bruv.

01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:14.390
真棒
Perfect.

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:37.010
艾格西  你去哪
Eggsy, where are you going?

01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:39.370
不用拿香槟  飞机上有好多呢
There's no need for champagne, we got loads in the plane.

01:58:46.370 --> 01:58:47.680
你拯救了世界吗

01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:49.760
是的
Yes, I did.

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:53.610
那...你要进来吗
So... are you gonna come in?

01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:56.000
当然

梅林  这牢房锁了  我怎么进去
Merlin, this cell is locked. How do I get in?

01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:07.070
2625.

01:59:11.450 --> 01:59:13.510
梅林  你真棒
Merlin, you're the governor.

01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:17.720
你欠我个人情  艾格西
You owe me, Eggsy.

01:59:24.230 --> 01:59:25.300
艾格西
Eggsy!

01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:32.470
这画面太美了
Oh my word.

02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:22.580
米歇尔  把那玩意儿关了  难听死了

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:27.040
我挺喜欢这歌的  继续放吧  妈
I rather like that song. Leave it on there, ma.

02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:32.660
小废物回来了呀
Mugsy's back.

02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:36.030
终于有胆量跟我说话了吗  小子
You finally come to have that word with me, have you, son?

02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:37.440
还是你穿得人模狗样
Or are you gonna run away again

02:00:37.450 --> 02:00:39.670
是为了拿去法院当借口跑路啊
and pretend you're going to court, dressed like that?

02:00:39.690 --> 02:00:41.000
你是说这身吗
Oh, you mean this?

02:00:42.690 --> 02:00:43.570
不
No.

02:00:44.530 --> 02:00:45.240
我认识了一位
I know this bloke who's

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:47.950
萨维尔街定制店的接班人
just taken over a tailor shop on Saville Row.

02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:50.230

你给我坐下  想让她见你
Sit down, you. The only place she'll be visiting

02:01:03.070 --> 02:01:04.920
除非你被揍住院了  明白吗
is you in a fucking hospital, did you hear?

02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:06.530
跟他较什么劲  迪恩
Just leave him alone, Dean!

02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:08.980
艾格西  快走吧  走吧宝贝
Eggsy, go. Please, just go, babe.

02:01:10.230 --> 02:01:13.050
-好吧  -没错  听妈妈的话
- All right. - Yes, do as mummy says.

02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:14.810
怎么没让你的裁缝朋友
Why don't you ask that tailor friend of yours

02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:17.720
给你做身胆小鬼套装啊  小废物
to knock up a nice chicken costume? It'll suit you, you mug.

02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:21.950
我有一位挚友说过
As a good friend once said...

02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:25.100
明礼
Manners...

02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:28.380

02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:31.780
